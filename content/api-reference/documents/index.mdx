Verified Customers of type `personal` or `business` and of status `document` require color photos of identifying documents to be uploaded for manual review in order to be verified. Currently, SDK support for document upload only exists for Ruby, Node.js, and Python. To upload a document using other languages, you must use an external HTTP library.

For more information on handling the Customer verification status of `document`, reference our [Customer verification](https://developers.dwolla.com/resources/customer-verification/handling-verification-statuses.html) resource article.
