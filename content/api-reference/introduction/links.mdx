Relationships and available actions for a resource are represented with links. All resources have a `_links` attribute. At a minimum, all resources will have a `self` link which indicates the URL of the resource itself.

Some links, such as `funding-sources`, give you a URL which you can follow to access related resources. For example, the customer resource has a `funding-sources` link which, when followed, will list the customer's available funding sources.

Responses which contain a collection of resources have pagination links, `first`, `next`, `last`, and `prev`.
