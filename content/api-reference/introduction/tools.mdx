The following section will outline development tools you can take advantage of to assist in your integration with the Dwolla API. The available tools can help to improve your testing and development workflow, as well as aid in solving a difficult problem (e.g. UI generation) when integrating Dwolla into your application.

### Dwolla Hal-Forms

[Dwolla HAL-Forms](https://github.com/Dwolla/hal-forms) is an extension of the [HAL spec](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) and was created to describe how Dwolla represents forms in the API. The extension starts with the media type. The media type should be used as a profile link as part of the `Accept` header of the request in conjunction with the Dwolla HAL style media type. By including these two media-type identifiers in the Accept header, the API knows that you’re looking for a form for the given resource.

##### Example Accept header value

`application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json; profile="https://github.com/dwolla/hal-forms"`

The primary benefit is the ability to dynamically generate your UI based on the state of a particular resource. Your application can easily transition state without knowing Dwolla's business rules and what information needs to included in the actual request to transition state. When an `"edit-form"` link relation is returned on the resource, then your application can follow the link by making a GET request to that resource, including the header shown above. The response will include a simple JSON response body that contains information on the HTTP method, message content-type, and the request parameters used when sending the request to the Dwolla API. **Note:** Currently, forms are only returned for creating & editing customers, but we’re looking forward to expanding them across our existing and future endpoints.

Reference [the spec](https://github.com/Dwolla/hal-forms) for more information on the properties that can be returned in the Dwolla HAL-FORMS response. Or read a [blog post](https://www.dwolla.com/updates/simplified-customer-onboarding-through-a-better-formed-api/) from one of our developers on building out this functionality.
