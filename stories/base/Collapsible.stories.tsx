    Yes, although this is not necessary, nor recommended. Dwolla manually
    reviews all documents, so sending more documents than necessary may slow
    down the verification process for your Customers.

    Receive funds - Yes - <Link text="Here is a link." href="#" /> Note that

    <Paragraph>
      Your Customer is able to send multiple separate transfers as long as each
      transfer amount is less than the transfer limit defined in your services
      agreement.

      <Paragraph>
        Example Scenario: The transaction limit for my Customer is $10,000 and
        they need to send $15,000.
        <br />
        In this case, you can prompt your Customer to send two transfers. One
        for $10,000 and another for $5,000.
