# Building With Drop-in Components

Dwolla offers a robust white labeled payments API that enables businesses to fully customize the user experience end-to-end. The flexibility provided with the Dwolla platform offers a high degree of customization enabling you, the integrating business, to design and build the entire payments experience. Your business is responsible for all interactions with your end users, including collecting required information via your application and sending it to Dwolla via [the API](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference).

Dwolla’s UI Components are low-code tools designed to abstract away as much of the front-end work involved for interacting with your end-user for Dwolla related functions. The components library has modularized many aspects of the Dwolla Platform and offers pre-built “drop-in” components that can be customized to match the look and feel of your application’s UI.

In this guide, we’ll cover the basics of leveraging Dwolla’s UI Components library to drop-in a wide range of payment functionalities into your application.

## Before you begin

If you haven’t already, we encourage you to create a Sandbox account. This will allow you to follow along with the steps outlined in this guide. Check out our [Sandbox guide](/guides/sandbox/) to learn more.

In addition to using the Dwolla Components Library, you’ll need a [server-side SDK](/sdks-tools) in order to facilitate the API request to Dwolla to retrieve a [client-token](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/drop-in-components/create-client-token). A client-token is a unique token scoped to the end-user/Customer performing the action on the front-end of your web application.

In order to utilize these drop-in components, you will want to have an understanding of the different Customer account types available to be created for your end-users. For more information on Customer types, c​heck out our [Concept article](/concepts/customer-types/).

In this guide, we’ll learn how to use the “Create a Business Verified Customer” component. Let’s get started!
