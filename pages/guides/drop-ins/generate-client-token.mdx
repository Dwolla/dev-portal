# Step 2: Generate a client token

Regardless of which drop-in component is being used by your application, the dwolla-web.js JavaScript library will require a unique “client-token” or a server side route that is used to generate a client token to be passed in on configuration. A client token contains granular permissions and is scoped to the end-user/Customer that is performing the action within your web application.

Client-tokens are single-use tokens that are valid for up to 1 hour after being generated. More than one client token can be generated and valid at one time.

#### Token vs. Token URL

For flow components like Business Verified Customers, Personal Verified Customers, and Payins, it is recommended to use token URL. Flow components are designed to support drop-ins that have multiple isolated functions connected together into a single user flow. Creating a server-side endpoint that can be called by the dwolla-web library when an action needs to be performed within the flow simplifies the integration experience.

For isolated functions, single, or non-flow components, the client token can be utilized.

### Setup a token endpoint server side

Flow components require a token endpoint. This is necessary and allows for fetching client-tokens as needed throughout the customer creation process.

This endpoint should simply act as a passthrough to the client-tokens endpoint. It takes the request body and makes a client-token call. Upon success, it returns the token off of the response.

### Client token request and response

The API request to /client-tokens requires an action and a “link” that identifies the Customer that is performing the action. Your application must obtain [application authorization](https://docs.dwolla.com/#application-authorization) in order to authenticate the API request to Dwolla. The “Upgrade to a Personal Verified Customer” component requires the `customer.update` action. For a full list of actions available, view our [API Reference docs](https://docs.dwolla.com/#create-a-client-token).

```raw
POST https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/client-tokens
Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
{
"action": "customer.update”,
  "_links": {
    “customer”: {
        “href”: “https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/{{customerId}}”
    }
  }
}

...

{
 "token": "4adF858jPeQ9RnojMHdqSD2KwsvmhO7Ti7cI5woOiBGCpH5krY"
}
```

```ruby
# Using DwollaV2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-ruby
request_body = {
  :_links => {
    :customer => {
      :href => "https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/707177c3-bf15-4e7e-b37c-55c3898d9bf4"
    }
  },
  :action => "customer.update"
}

client_token = app_token.post "client-tokens", request_body
client_token.token # => "4adF858jPeQ9RnojMHdqSD2KwsvmhO7Ti7cI5woOiBGCpH5krY"
```

```php
<?php
// Using dwollaswagger - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-swagger-php
$request_body = array (
  '_links' =>
  array (
    'customer' =>
    array (
      'href' => 'https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/8779a1f7-7a98-4a86-921e-83539f6c895e',
    ),
  ),
  'action' => 'customer.update'
);
$clientTokensApi = new DwollaSwagger\TokensApi($apiClient);
$clientToken = $clientTokensApi->clientTokens($request_body);
?>
```

```python
# Using dwollav2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-python
request_body = {
  '_links': {
    'customer': {
      'href': 'https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/707177c3-bf15-4e7e-b37c-55c3898d9bf4'
    }
  },
  'action': 'customer.update'
}

client_token = app_token.post('client-tokens', request_body)
client_token.body['token'] # => '4adF858jPeQ9RnojMHdqSD2KwsvmhO7Ti7cI5woOiBGCpH5krY'
```

```javascript
// Using DwollaV2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-node
var requestBody = {
  _links: {
    customer: {
      href:
        "https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/707177c3-bf15-4e7e-b37c-55c3898d9bf4",
    },
  },
  action: "customer.update",
};

appToken.post("/client-tokens", requestBody).then((res) => res.body.token); // => '4adF858jPeQ9RnojMHdqSD2KwsvmhO7Ti7cI5woOiBGCpH5krY'
```

### Send client token to front-end

After obtaining a client-token, you will pass this token to your front-end. The example shown below demonstrates this process using Express.

```javascript
// see examples above
const myClientToken = "...";

// POST /dwolla-client-token
app.post("/dwolla-client-token", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ token: myClientToken });
});
```
