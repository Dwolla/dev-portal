# Step 1: Setup and configuration

We’ll begin by setting up and configuring both the Dwolla Components library and installing a server-side SDK. This guide assumes that you have the basic structure of a web application set up and running, which includes a backend language (e.g. Node.js, Python, etc.) and a web front end (HTML, CSS, Javascript).

To get up and running quickly, take a look at our [drop-ins examples repo](https://github.com/Dwolla/drop-ins-examples) which is a basic Node.js app that uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

### Include dwolla-web.js

Begin the client-side implementation by including dwolla-web.js in the ‘head’ of your HTML page. The Dwolla Components library containing all of the drop-in UI components are available directly from Dwolla’s content delivery network (CDN). As we continue to evolve the components library, it will soon be available to be installed via NPM.

```html
<head>
  <script
    type="text/javascript"
    src="//cdn.dwolla.com/v2/dwolla-web.js"
  ></script>
</head>
```

### Install and configure server-side SDK

Dwolla has a collection of SDKs available in a variety of server-side programming languages. You’ll want to be sure to install an SDK or utilize a third party HTTP client library before completing Step 2.

#### Install

```ruby
gem install dwolla_v2
```

```python
pip install dwollav2
```

```javascript
npm install dwolla-v2
```

```php
composer require dwolla/dwollaswagger
composer install
```

#### Configure

```ruby
require 'dwolla_v2'

# Navigate to https://dashboard.dwolla.com/applications (production) or https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications (Sandbox) for your application key and secret.
app_key = "..."
app_secret = "..."
$dwolla = DwollaV2::Client.new(key: app_key, secret: app_secret) do |config|
  config.environment = :sandbox # optional - defaults to production
end
```

```python
import dwollav2

# Navigate to https://dashboard.dwolla.com/applications (production) or https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications (Sandbox) for your application key and secret.
app_key = '...'
app_secret = '...'
client = dwollav2.Client(key = app_key,
                        secret = app_secret,
                        environment = 'sandbox') # optional - defaults to production
```

```javascript
const dwolla = require("dwolla-v2");

// Navigate to https://dashboard.dwolla.com/applications (production) or https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications (Sandbox) for your application key and secret.
const appKey = "...";
const appSecret = "...";
const client = new dwolla.Client({
  key: appKey,
  secret: appSecret,
  environment: "sandbox", // optional - defaults to production
});
```

```php
<?php
require('../path/to/vendor/autoload.php');

DwollaSwagger\Configuration::$username = 'API_KEY';
DwollaSwagger\Configuration::$password = 'API_SECRET';

// For Sandbox
$apiClient = new DwollaSwagger\ApiClient("https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com");

// For production
// $apiClient = new DwollaSwagger\ApiClient("https://api.dwolla.com");
?>
```

Now that we’ve completed our initial setup, we’ll move on to the next step of generating a “client-token” which will be used when configuring the drop-in components library.
