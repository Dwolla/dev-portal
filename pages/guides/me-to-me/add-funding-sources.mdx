# Step 2: Adding a Funding Source

Within Dwolla, the sending party must always [verify their bank account](https://developers.dwolla.com/resources/funding-source-verification.html) in order to be eligible to create a transfer.

## Bank Addition and Verification methods

There are three ways of adding a bank to a Customer with the Dwolla API. A simplified table below outlines the similarities and differences of each method.

| Bank Addition Method                     | Will the bank be verified?    | Required Information            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| API - Account // Routing Number          | Optional - With Microdeposits | Bank Account and Routing Number |
| Dwolla.js - Instant Account Verification | Yes                           | Online Bank Credentials         |
| Third party - Plaid                      | Yes                           | Online Bank Credentials         |

For an in-depth look at these methods and the features and benefits of each, take a look at our [developer resource article.](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/funding-sources.html)

In this guide, we’ll be utilizing Dwolla’s Instant account verification (IAV) method via dwolla.js for adding and verifying our user’s bank account. Micro-deposit verification can take 1-2 business days to complete, so if speed is a primary factor in your user experience then you may want to feature IAV as your preferred bank verification method.

## Step 2A: Adding a bank to the Verified Personal Customer

Next, you will attach a verified funding source for your Customer, which will be done using Instant Account Verification (IAV). This method will give your Customers the ability to add and verify their bank account in a matter of minutes by authenticating with their online banking credentials. Once your Customer reaches the page in your application to add a bank account you’ll ask Dwolla’s server to generate an IAV token.

### Generate a single-use IAV token for your Customer (view schema in ‘raw’)

```bash
POST https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/247B1BD8-F5A0-4B71-A898-F62F67B8AE1C/iav-token
Content-Type: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json
Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json
Authorization: Bearer 0Sn0W6kzNicvoWhDbQcVSKLRUpGjIdlPSEYyrHqrDDoRnQwE7Q

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/247B1BD8-F5A0-4B71-A898-F62F67B8AE1C/iav-token"
    }
  },
  "token": "lr0Ax1zwIpeXXt8sJDiVXjPbwEeGO6QKFWBIaKvnFG0Sm2j7vL"
}
```

```php
<?php
$customersApi = new DwollaSwagger\CustomersApi($apiClient);

$fsToken = $customersApi->getCustomerIavToken("https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/247B1BD8-F5A0-4B71-A898-F62F67B8AE1C");
$fsToken->token; # => "lr0Ax1zwIpeXXt8sJDiVXjPbwEeGO6QKFWBIaKvnFG0Sm2j7vL"
?>
```

```ruby
customer_url = 'https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/247B1BD8-F5A0-4B71-A898-F62F67B8AE1C'

# Using DwollaV2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-ruby (Recommended)
customer = app_token.post "#{customer_url}/iav-token"
customer.token # => "lr0Ax1zwIpeXXt8sJDiVXjPbwEeGO6QKFWBIaKvnFG0Sm2j7vL"
```

```python
# Using dwollav2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-python (Recommended)
customer_url = 'https://api.dwolla.com/customers/247B1BD8-F5A0-4B71-A898-F62F67B8AE1C'

app_token.post('%s/iav-token' % customer_url)
```

```javascript
// Using dwolla-v2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-node
var customerUrl =
  "https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/247B1BD8-F5A0-4B71-A898-F62F67B8AE1C";

appToken.post(`${customerUrl}/iav-token`).then((res) => res.body.token); // => 'lr0Ax1zwIpeXXt8sJDiVXjPbwEeGO6QKFWBIaKvnFG0Sm2j7vL'
```

Then, you’ll pass this single-use IAV token to the client-side of your application where it will be used in the JavaScript function dwolla.iav.start. This token will be used to authenticate the request asking Dwolla to render the IAV flow. Before calling this function you’ll want to include dwolla.js in the HEAD of your page.

```htmlnoselect
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.dwolla.com/1/dwolla.js"></script>
</head>
```

Next, you’ll add in a container to the body of your page where you want to render the IAV flow.

```htmlnoselect
<div id="mainContainer">
  <input type="button" id="start" value="Add Bank">
</div>

<div id="iavContainer"></div>
```

Now that you have dwolla.js initialized on the page and the container created where you’ll render the IAV flow, you’ll create a JavaScript function that responds when clicking the “Add bank” button on your page. Once your Customer clicks “Add Bank”, your application will call dwolla.iav.start() passing in the following arguments: the iavContainer element where IAV will render, a string value of your single-use IAV token, and a callback function that will handle any error or response.

```javascriptnoselect
<script type="text/javascript">
  $('#start').click(function() {
    var iavToken = 'lr0Ax1zwIpeXXt8sJDiVXjPbwEeGO6QKFWBIaKvnFG0Sm2j7vL';
    dwolla.configure('sandbox');
    dwolla.iav.start(iavToken, {
      container: 'iavContainer',
      stylesheets: [
        'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato&subset=latin,latin-ext'
      ],
      microDeposits: false,
      fallbackToMicroDeposits: false
    }, function(err, res) {
      console.log('Error: ' + JSON.stringify(err) + ' -- Response: ' + JSON.stringify(res));
    });
  });
</script>
```

Your Customer will complete the IAV flow by authenticating with their online banking credentials. Go through the IAV flow and add the `checking` account first.

You’ll know the bank account was successfully added and verified if you receive a JSON response in your callback that includes a link to the newly created funding source. We recommend storing the full URL for future use, as it will be needed for actions such as creating transfers.

### Example success callback

```
{"_links":{"funding-source":{"href":"https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/funding-sources/80275e83-1f9d-4bf7-8816-2ddcd5ffc197"}}}
```

## Step 2B: Handle Webhooks

If you have an active webhook subscription, you will receive the `customer_funding_source_added` webhook after the Customer goes through IAV.

On successful verification, you will receive the `customer_funding_source_verified` webhook.

## Step 2C: Add Savings Account

In the steps outlined above, we have walked through how to implement IAV and add a Customer's `checking` account.
You will want to repeat these steps and add the `savings` account.
