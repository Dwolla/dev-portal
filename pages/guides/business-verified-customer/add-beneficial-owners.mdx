# Step 3: Adding Beneficial Owner(s)

## The Basics

To help the government fight financial crime, the existing United States Federal customer due diligence rules were amended to clarify and strengthen [customer due diligence requirements.](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/11/2016-10567/customer-due-diligence-requirements-for-financial-institutions#footnote-44-p29407) The customer due diligence rule imposes a requirement for verifying the identity of beneficial owner(s) of Dwolla’s partners and users that are not natural persons. These legal entities can be abused to disguise involvement in terrorist financing, money laundering, tax evasion, corruption, fraud, and other financial crimes. Requiring the disclosure of key individuals who ultimately own or control a legal entity (i.e., the beneficial owners) helps law enforcement investigate and prosecute these crimes.

## Check the status of an individual Beneficial Owner

After a beneficial owner has been created, the beneficial owner’s identity needs to go through a verification process. A beneficial owner that has a status of `incomplete` or `document` will impact the business verified Customer's eligibility to send or receive funds. When a beneficial owner has been successfully verified by Dwolla, the business verified Customer’s status will be set to `verified`. Reference the table below for more information on the events that correspond to each of the beneficial owner statuses:

#### Individual Beneficial Owner statuses and events

Let’s check to see if the Owner was successfully verified or not. We are going to use the location of the Beneficial Owner resource that was just created.

## Handling an individual beneficial owner Status

Congrats! You have created a beneficial owner for a business verified Customer, however, the successful creation of a beneficial Owner doesn’t necessarily mean they are identity verified. You will want to ensure that the beneficial Owner is `verified`, as the business verified Customer will be unable to send or receive funds until the owner has a verified status.

### Handling `incomplete` status

An `incomplete` status occurs when a beneficial owner's identity scores are too low during the initial verification attempt. Dwolla will trigger a `customer_beneficial_owner_reverification_needed` event which notifies your application to prompt the Customer to [submit another identity verification attempt](https://docs.dwolla.com/#update-a-beneficial-owner) for the beneficial owner. The second attempt will give our identity vendor more accurate information in an attempt to receive a sufficient score to approve the beneficial owner. The Customer will only have one opportunity to correct any mistakes.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  You need to gather new information if the beneficial owner is placed into the
  <code>incomplete</code> status; simply passing the same information will result
  in the same insufficient scores. All fields that were required in the initial beneficial
  owner creation attempt will be required in the <code>incomplete</code>
  attempt.

Check the beneficial owner's status again. The beneficial owner will either be in the `verified` or `document` state of verification.

### Handling `document` status

If a beneficial owner is not `verified`, the only other state the beneficial owner can be in is `document`. If the beneficial owner has a status of `document`, they will need to upload additional pieces of information in order to verify their identity. Use the [create a document](https://docs.dwolla.com/#beneficial-owners) endpoint when uploading a colored scan of the identifying document. The document(s) will then be reviewed by Dwolla; this review may take up to 1-2 business days to approve or reject.

### Determining verification `documents` needed

#### US persons

A color scanned photo of the Beneficial Owner’s identifying document can be specified as documentType: `license` (state issued driver's license), or `idCard` (U.S. government-issued photo id card).

#### Non-US persons

A color scanned photo of the Beneficial Owner’s identifying document can be specified as documentType: `passport`

### Uploading a document

To upload a color photo of the document, you’ll initiate a multipart form-data POST request from your backend server to the beneficial owners documents endpoint. The file must be either a .jpg, .jpeg, or .png. Files must be no larger than 10MB in size.

You’ll also get a `beneficial_owner_verification_document_uploaded` event to let you know the document was successfully uploaded.

After removal of a Beneficial Owner, they can be re-added and go through the verification process again. You can also remove a beneficial owner if they no longer own 25% or more of the business.

The successful creation and verification of a beneficial owner doesn’t necessarily mean the business verified Customer is verified and ready to send or receive funds. The final step in creating a business verified Customer is to certify that all information provided is correct. Read on to view the procedures on how to certify your owners.
