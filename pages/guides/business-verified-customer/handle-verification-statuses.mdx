# Step 2: Handling Business Verified Customer Statuses

## The basics

You have successfully created a business verified Customer; however, there are cases where Dwolla will need more information to fully verify the identity of the Controller and/or Business. Read on to learn more.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  If your Business and Controller are already identity verified, you can skip to

  to continue with your business verified Customer onboarding.

## Verification statuses and corresponding events

As a developer, you will want to handle the various Customer statuses that can be returned.

| Customer status | Event Topic Name                      | Transaction restricted?            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| verified        | customer_verified                     | No                                 | The identifying information submitted was sufficient in verifying the Customer account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| retry           | customer_reverification_needed        | Yes - Cannot send funds            | The initial identity verification attempt failed because the information provided did not satisfy Dwolla’s verification check. You can make one additional attempt by changing some or all the attributes of the existing Customer with a POST request. All fields are required on the retry attempt. If the additional attempt fails, the resulting status will be either `document` or `suspended`. |
| document        | customer_verification_document_needed | Yes - Cannot send funds            | Dwolla requires additional documentation to identify the Customer in the document status. Once a document is uploaded it will be reviewed for verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| suspended       | customer_suspended                    | Yes - Cannot send or receive funds | The Customer is suspended and may neither send nor receive funds. Contact Account Management for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Handling `retry` status

A `retry` status occurs when a Customer’s identity scores are too low during the initial verification attempt. Dwolla will require the **full 9-digits** of the Controller’s SSN on the retry attempt in order to give our identity vendor more information in an attempt to receive a sufficient score to approve the Customer account. The Customer will have one more opportunity to correct any mistakes.

<AlertBar variation="warning">
  You need to gather new information if the Customer is placed into the{" "}
  <code>retry</code>
  status; simply passing the same information will result in the same insufficient
  scores.
</AlertBar>

All fields that were required in the initial Customer creation attempt will be required in the retry attempt, along with the full 9-digit SSN.

## Handling `document` status

If the Customer has a status of `document`, the Customer will need to upload additional pieces of information in order to verify the account. Use the [create a document](https://docs.dwolla.com/#create-a-document) endpoint when uploading a colored scan of the identifying document. The document(s) will then be reviewed by Dwolla; this review may take up to 1-2 business days to approve or reject.

You can provide the following best practices to the Customer in order to reduce the chances of a document being rejected:

- All 4 Edges of the document should be visible
- A dark/high contrast background should be used
- At least 90% of the image should be the document
- Should be at least 300dpi
- Capture image from directly above the document
- Make sure that the image is properly aligned, not rotated, tilted or skewed
- No flash to reduce glare
- No black and white documents
- No expired IDs

### Determining verification documents needed

When a business verified Customer is placed in the `document` verification status, Dwolla will return a link in the API response after [retrieving a Customer](https://docs.dwolla.com/#retrieve-a-customer), which will be used by an application to determine if documentation is needed. For business verified Customers, different links can be returned depending on whether or not documents are needed for a Controller, the business, both the Controller and business, or for the DBA (Doing Business As). Additionally, embedded errors are included in the Customer resource which include information about the next steps required to get the Customer verified (see example response below). Refer to the table below for the list of possible links and their description. Refer to the [acceptable document types](#document-types) section for more information on what types of documents are accepted for businesses and Controllers.

| Link name                                    | Description                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| verify-with-document                         | Identifies if documents are needed only for a Controller.                    |
| verify-business-with-document                | Identifies if documents are needed only for a business.                      |
| verify-controller-and-business-with-document | Identifies if documents are needed for both the Controller and business.     |
| upload-dba-document                          | Identifies if documents are needed for a business's DBA (Doing Business As). |

### Uploading a document

To upload a color photo of the document, you’ll initiate a multipart form-data POST request from your backend server to `https://api.dwolla.com/customers/{id}/documents`. The file must be either a .jpg, .jpeg, or .png. Files must be no larger than 10MB in size. Additionally, Business Documents can also be uploaded in a .pdf format.

You’ll also get a webhook with a `customer_verification_document_uploaded` event to let you know the document was successfully uploaded.

#### Request and response

```bash
curl -X POST
\ -H "Authorization: Bearer tJlyMNW6e3QVbzHjeJ9JvAPsRglFjwnba4NdfCzsYJm7XbckcR"
\ -H "Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json"

```

```php

```

```ruby
# Using DwollaV2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-ruby
customer_url = 'https://api.dwolla.com/customers/132681fa-1b4d-4181-8ff2-619ca46235b1'

file = Faraday::UploadIO.new('mclovin.jpg', 'image/jpeg')
document = app_token.post "#{customer_url}/documents", file: file, documentType: 'license'
document.response_headers[:location] # => "https://api.dwolla.com/documents/11fe0bab-39bd-42ee-bb39-275afcc050d0"
```

```python
# Using dwollav2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-python (Recommended)
customer_url = 'https://api.dwolla.com/customers/132681fa-1b4d-4181-8ff2-619ca46235b1'

document = app_token.post('%s/documents' % customer_url, file = open('mclovin.jpg', 'rb'), documentType = 'license')
document.headers['location'] # => 'https://api.dwolla.com/documents/11fe0bab-39bd-42ee-bb39-275afcc050d0'
```

```javascript
// Using dwolla-v2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-node
var customerUrl =
  "https://api.dwolla.com/customers/132681fa-1b4d-4181-8ff2-619ca46235b1";

var requestBody = new FormData();
body.append("file", fs.createReadStream("mclovin.jpg"), {
  filename: "mclovin.jpg",
  contentType: "image/jpeg",
  knownLength: fs.statSync("mclovin.jpg").size,
});
body.append("documentType", "license");

dwolla.post(`${customerUrl}/documents`, requestBody).then(function (res) {
  res.headers.get("location"); // => "https://api.dwolla.com/documents/11fe0bab-39bd-42ee-bb39-275afcc050d0"
});
```

If the document was successfully uploaded, the response will be a HTTP 201 Created with the URL of the new document resource contained in the Location header.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/documents/11fe0bab-39bd-42ee-bb39-275afcc050d0
```

### Document review process

Once created, the document will be reviewed by Dwolla. When our team has made a decision to approve or reject, which may take up to 1-2 business days, we’ll create either a `customer_verification_document_approved` or `customer_verification_document_failed` event.

If the document was sufficient, the Customer may be verified in this process. If not, we may need additional documentation. Note: Reference the [determining verification documents needed](#document-types) section for more information on determining if additional documents are needed after an approved or failed event is triggered.

If the document was found to be fraudulent or doesn’t match the identity of the Customer, the Customer will be suspended.

### Document failure

A document can fail if, for example, the Customer uploaded the wrong type of document or the `.jpg` or `.png` file supplied was not readable (i.e. blurry, not well lit, not in color, or cuts off a portion of the identifying image). If you receive a `customer_verification_document_failed` webhook, you’ll need to upload another document. To retrieve the failure reason for the document upload, you’ll retrieve the document by its ID. Contained in the response will be a `failureReason` field which corresponds to one or more of the following values. In case of a failure due to multiple reasons, an additional `allFailureReasons` of `reason`s and `description`s is also returned :

| Failure reason            | Description                                                            |

| `BusinessTypeMismatch`    | Business type chosen does not match document                           |
| `ScanDobMismatch`         | Scan DOB does not match DOB on account                                 |
| `ScanFailedOther`         | ID may be fraudulent or a generic example ID image                     |
| `ScanIdExpired`           | ID is expired or missing expiration date                               |
| `ScanIdTypeNotSupported`  | ID may be a military ID, firearm license, or other unsupported ID type |
| `ScanNameMismatch`        | Scan name does not match name on account                               |
| `ScanNotReadable`         | Image blurry, too dark, or obscured by glare                           |
| `ScanNotUploaded`         | Scan not uploaded                                                      |

## Handling status: suspended

If the Customer is `suspended`, there’s no further action you can take to correct this using the API. You’ll need to contact support@dwolla.com or your account manager for assistance.

## Next steps: Beneficial Owners

The successful creation of a business verified Customer and Controller doesn’t necessarily mean the Customer is fully verified and eligible to transfer. After successfully creating your business verified Customer, you will need to check to see if the beneficial ownership requirements apply to you. To learn how to add beneficial owner(s) to your Customer, read on in the next step.
