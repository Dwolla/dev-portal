# Business Customer Verification

This article will walk through the identity verification process for [business verified Customers](https://developers.dwolla.com/articles/customers) within the Dwolla API.

## The basics

A business verified Customer represents a business that intends to send or receive funds on your platform. In any transaction, at least one party—either the sender or the receiver—must complete the [identity verification](https://www.dwolla.com/updates/guide-to-cip-customer-identification-program-dwolla-payments-api/) process as outlined in this article.

### Key Terminology

- **Account Admin** - The representative creating the business verified Customer on behalf of the business and Controller.
- **Controller** - Any natural individual who holds significant responsibilities to control, manage, or direct a company or other corporate entity (i.e. CEO, CFO, General Partner, President, etc). A company may have more than one controller, but only one controller’s information must be collected.
- **Beneficial owner** - Any natural person who, directly or indirectly, owns 25% or more of the equity interests of the company.
- **Beneficial ownership certification** - An action taken by the Account Admin to confirm that the information provided is correct.
- **EIN (Employer Identification Number)** - A unique identification number that is assigned to a business entity so that they can easily be identified by the Internal Revenue Service.
