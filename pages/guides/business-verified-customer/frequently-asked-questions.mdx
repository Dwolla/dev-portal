      Q: My Customer has a <code>verified</code> status, but is unable to send
      funds. Why is this?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    Your Customer has likely not completed the bank verification process. You
    can check to see the status of the funding source{" "}
    <a href="https://docs.dwolla.com/#list-funding-sources-for-a-customer">
      {" "}
      via the API{" "}
    </a>{" "}
    or by going into the{" "}
    <a href="https://www.dwolla.com/platform/dashboard">Dwolla dashboard.</a>

<Collapsible

      Q: Can I change a <code>Business Verified</code> Customer type to an{" "}
      <code>Unverified</code> Customer type?
    </span>
  }

  <p>
    No. Downgrade functionality is not supported for Dwolla Verified Customers.

<Collapsible

    <span>
      Q: My Customer has a <code>document</code> status. Can I submit more than
      one document via the API?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    Yes, although this is not necessary, nor recommended. Dwolla manually
    reviews all documents, so sending more documents than necessary may slow
    down the verification process for your Customers.

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: My end user is not a US resident, can they still create a Personal
      Verified Customer via the API to access my application?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    No. At this time, Dwolla will create Business Verified Customers when they
    have a proper business EIN or SSN (for Sole Proprietorships only).

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: My Customer needs to send more funds than is allowed in my Dwolla
      services agreement. What is the best way to go about this?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    Your Customer is able to send multiple separate transfers as long as each
    transfer amount is less than the transfer limit defined in your services
    agreement. <br />
    <br />
    Example Scenario: The transaction limit for my Customer is $10,000 and they
    need to send $15,000. In this case, you can prompt your Customer to send two
    transfers. One for $10,000 and another for $5,000.
