      Q: How do I determine if my Customer is fully verified and eligible to
      start transacting?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    You can determine the eligibility of the customer to start transacting in
    the Dwolla platform by the presence of the <code>send</code> and{" "}
    <code>receive</code> links in the customer resource.
    <br /> <br />
    <code>send</code> - Denotes that the customer is eligible to start sending
    funds if they have a verified funding-source attached.
    <br /> <br />
    <code>receive</code> - Denotes that the customer is eligible to receive
    funds into their Dwolla balance or an attached bank funding-source.{" "}
    <strong>Note:</strong> Until the following actions have been completed, any
    funds received by the Customer will remain in their Dwolla Balance unable to
    be withdrawn or sent to another Customer or Account:

      Q: My Customer has a <code>verified</code> status, but is unable to send
      funds. Why is this?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    Your Customer has likely not completed the bank verification process. You
    can check to see the status of the funding source{" "}
    <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/funding-sources/list-funding-sources-for-a-customer">
      {" "}
      via the API{" "}
    </a>{" "}
    or by going into the{" "}

      Q: Can I change a <code>Business Verified</code> Customer type to an{" "}

    No. Downgrade functionality is not supported for Dwolla Verified Customers.

<Collapsible

    <span>
      Q: My Customer has a <code>document</code> status. Can I submit more than
      one document via the API?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    Yes, although this is not necessary, nor recommended. Dwolla manually
    reviews all documents, so sending more documents than necessary may slow
    down the verification process for your Customers.

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: My end user is not a US resident, can they still create a Personal
      Verified Customer via the API to access my application?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    No. At this time, Dwolla will create Business Verified Customers when they
    have a proper business EIN or SSN (for Sole Proprietorships only).
