#### **Q: My Customer has a `verified` status, but unable to send funds. Why is this?**

- Your Customer has likely not completed the bank verification process. You can check to see the status of the funding source [via the API](https://docs.dwolla.com/#list-funding-sources-for-a-customer) or by going into the [Dwolla dashboard](https://www.dwolla.com/platform/dashboard/).

#### **Q: Can I `change` a ‘business verified’ Customer type to an `Unverified` Customer type?**

- No. Downgrade functionality is not supported for Dwolla Verified Customers.

#### **Q: My Customer has a `document` status. Can I submit more than one document via the API?**

- Yes, although this is not necessary, nor recommended. Dwolla manually reviews all documents, so sending more documents than necessary may slow down the verification process for your Customers.

#### **Q: My end user is not a US resident, can they still create a Personal Verified Customer via the API to access my application?**

- No. At this time, Dwolla will create Business Verified Customers when they have a proper business EIN or SSN (for Sole Proprietorships only).

#### **Q: My Customer needs to send more funds than is allowed in my Dwolla services agreement. What is the best way to go about this?**

- Your Customer is able to send multiple separate transfers as long as each transfer amount is less than the transfer limit defined in your services agreement.

  > Example Scenario: The transaction limit for my Customer is $10,000 and they need to send $15,000. In this case, you can prompt your Customer to send two transfers. One for $10,000 and another for $5,000.

## Beneficial Owner Eligibility

#### **Q: My Business Verified Customer is `verified` and my Beneficial Owners are `verified` but they cannot send funds. Why is this?**

- Your Customer will need to `certify` beneficial ownership information before your Customer will be eligible to send funds.

#### **Q: One of my Business Verified Customer’s Beneficial Owners is not yet in a `verified` status. What is my Customer’s eligibility for certain actions with Dwolla?**

- Send funds - No
- Receive funds - Yes
- Add and verify a bank funding source - Yes

#### **Q: When should my Beneficial Owner use `ssn`? When should they use the `passport`?**

- If your Beneficial Owner is an individual from the United States with a US-issued SSN, your Beneficial Owner will sign up with this method.
- If your Beneficial Owner is a non-US individual, they will use the `passport` object.
