      funds. Why is this?
    </span>
  }
>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your Customer has likely not completed the bank verification process. You
      can check to see the status of the funding source{" "}
      <a href="https://docs.dwolla.com/#list-funding-sources-for-a-customer">
        via the API
      </a>{" "}

<Collapsible

      Q: Can I change a <code>business verified</code> Customer type to an{" "}
      <code>unverified</code> Customer type?
    </span>

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: My Customer has a <code>document</code> status. Can I submit more than
      one document via the API?
    </span>
  }
>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Yes, although this is not necessary, nor recommended. Dwolla manually
      reviews all documents, so sending more documents than necessary may slow
      down the verification process for your Customers.
    </li>
  </ul>

<br />

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: My end user is not a US resident, can they still create a Personal
      Verified Customer via the API to access my application?
    </span>
  }
>
  <ul>
    <li>
      No. At this time, Dwolla will create Business Verified Customers when they
      have a proper business EIN or SSN (for Sole Proprietorships only).
    </li>
  </ul>
</Collapsible>

<br />

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: My Customer needs to send more funds than is allowed in my Dwolla
      services agreement. What is the best way to go about this?
    </span>
  }
>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Your Customer is able to send multiple separate transfers as long as each
      transfer amount is less than the transfer limit defined in your services
      agreement. <br />
      <br />
      Example Scenario: The transaction limit for my Customer is $10,000 and
      they need to send $15,000. In this case, you can prompt your Customer to
      send two transfers. One for $10,000 and another for $5,000.
    </li>
  </ul>
