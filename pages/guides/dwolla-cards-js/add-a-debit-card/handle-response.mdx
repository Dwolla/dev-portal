# Step 3: Handle JavaScript Callback

Your customer will then add their card information, including: Full Name, Card Number, Expiration Date, CVV, and Nickname. On submission of the form, you will need to handle the error or response which is triggered by the JavaScript callback. The callback function (err, res) allows you to determine if there is an error with the request (e.g. card expiration invalid) or if the response was successful.

If there is an error, display the error to the user to have them correct any fields and have them re-attempt to add their card by restarting the add a debit card flow.

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FastFundsIneligible    | The card is ineligible for Fast Funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| InvalidAddress         | The address is invalid. <br /> **Note:** This error is thrown when the address entered is different from the one that the card was issued with.
