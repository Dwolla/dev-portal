# Initiate micro-deposits

Once you POST to the [initiate-micro-deposits](https://docs.dwolla.com/#initiate-micro-deposits) link, Dwolla will send two small amounts to your customer's bank or credit union account. If the request is successful, Dwolla returns a `HTTP 201` and a link to the created micro-deposits resource `funding-sources/{id}/micro-deposits` in the location header. The micro-deposits resource can be later used to retrieve the status of micro-deposits or verify micro-deposit amounts. If your application is subscribed to webhooks, a webhook will be sent with the `microdeposits_added` event, notifying your application that micro-deposits are en route to your customerâ€™s bank account.
