# Step 2: Adding a Funding Source

Within Dwolla, the sending party must always have a verified funding source. Since your Customer is the one sending funds, they will need to both add and verify their bank funding source before being eligible to send funds.

The destination party, or the party receiving funds, does not need to have a verified funding source to receive these funds.

## Bank Addition and Verification Methods

There are currently two ways of adding a bank to a Customer with the Dwolla API. A simplified table below outlines the similarities and differences of each method.

| Bank Addition Method                                                                                                  | Will the bank be verified?    | Required Information            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| API - Account & Routing Number                                                                                        | Optional - With Microdeposits | Bank Account and Routing Number |
| Third Party - Plaid ([Example](https://github.com/Dwolla/integration-examples/tree/main/dwolla-plaid-funding-source)) | Yes                           | Online Bank Credentials         |

## Step 2A: Add a Bank to an Unverified Customer

In this step, we will create and attach a verified funding source to your Customer, which will be done using Plaid Link, a third-party bank verification provider. This method will give your Customers the ability to add and verify their bank account in a matter of seconds by authenticating using their online banking credentials.

Once your Customer reaches the page in your application to add a bank account, you will first use Plaid Link to authenticate the user's bank account, exchange the `public_token` for a `processor_token`, and then send the `processor_token` to Dwolla to create the funding source.

To integrate Dwolla with Plaid, we recommend checking out our [Add a Bank via Dwolla + Plaid Integration](/guides/plaid) guide. Additionally, if you would like to see a working example that creates a Dwolla funding source and instantly verifies it via Plaid Link (using Next.js/React), we recommend checking out our [dwolla-plaid-funding-source](https://github.com/Dwolla/integration-examples/blob/main/dwolla-plaid-funding-source) integration example on our GitHub profile.

## Step 2B: Handle Webhooks

Similar to creating a funding source manually and verifying it via microdeposits, when a funding source is created and instantly verified via Plaid Link, you will receive two webhooks: `customer_funding_source_added` and `customer_funding_source_verified`. The former is sent when the funding source is created, whereas the latter is sent when the funding source has been verified via your integration with Plaid.
