# Step 1: Creating your Customer

## Choose the Customer Type for your Funds Flow

Before your end user can send funds, they must be created as a Customer via the Dwolla API. The pay-ins funds flow is flexible in terms of choosing a Customer type to onboard, as both the `unverified` Customer and `verified` Customer types are eligible to send funds. To learn more on the different Customer types and the capabilities of each, check out our [customer types resource article](/concepts/customer-types).

## Step 1A. Create the Customer

While you can use the `verified` Customer type in this funds flow, we will be creating an `unverified` Customer in this guide.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  Providing the IP address of the end-user accessing your application as the
  <code>ipAddress</code> parameter. This enhances fraud detection and tracking.
</AlertBar>

When the Customer is successfully created by your application, you will receive a `201` HTTP response with an empty response body. You can reference the Location header to retrieve a link that represents the created Customer resource. We recommend storing the full URL for future use, as it will be necessary to complete additional actions, such as attaching a bank or correlating webhooks that are triggered for the end user in the Dwolla system.

## Step 1B. Handle Webhooks

If you have an active webhook subscription, you will receive the `customer_created` webhook immediately after the resource has been created.
