# Testing Funding Sources

### Test bank account numbers

Dwolla requires a valid U.S. routing number and a random account number between 4-17 digits to add a bank account. For testing purposes, you can use the routing number `222222226` or refer to the list of routing numbers from the [Federal Reserve Bank Services](https://www.frbservices.org/EPaymentsDirectory/agreement.html) website.

### Simulate IAV success and error scenarios in Sandbox

<AlertBar variation="warning">
  Deprecation Announcement: At the end of 2022, Dwolla will sunset our Instant
  Account Verification (IAV) product, which is powered by Dwolla.js. As
  alternative bank account verification options, we recommend utilizing one of
  our integrated third-party data providers prior to December 31, 2022 —{" "}

Dwolla's Sandbox environment uses a [fake service](https://www.dwolla.com/updates/fake-it-as-you-make-it-why-fake-services-are-awesome-for-developers/) which allows you to simulate the end user experience for adding and verifying a bank account within the IAV flow. The default "success" scenario is a happy path flow that includes: a single set of MFA questions, presentation of two valid accounts and one account without a routing number. Any text can be entered in the input fields to allow you to proceed through the IAV flow.

To help you test error scenarios, a flag and an option can be used in the first field (usually username or ID) for the bank you are trying to authenticate. The remaining input fields in the flow can be any string of text, as we allow you to proceed through the flow regardless of the information entered.

##### List of flag and option values for testing IAV errors

| Flag | Option          | User-facing message                                                                                                                                                |
| ---- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -e   | InvalidLogin    | Please make sure your login or security information is correct.                                                                                                    |
| -e   | AccountNotFound | Sorry, we’re unable to find your {BANK NAME} account. Please try again or use a different account.                                                                 |
| -e   | UnsupportedSite | Sorry, that financial institution is not supported. If possible, please choose a different one or an alternative method for connecting your financial institution. |
| -e   | AlreadyLoggedIn | If you're currently logged in to your {BANK NAME} account, please log out and try again.                                                                           |
| -e   | VisitSite       | We’re unable to process your information because the {BANK NAME} site is currently requiring additional action from you. Please resolve this, then try again.      |
| -e   | UnavailableSite | Sorry, there seem to be some technical difficulties while attempting to process your information. Please try again later.                                          |

### Test micro-deposit verification

If your application leverages the micro-deposit method of bank verification, Dwolla will transfer two deposits of less than `$0.10` to your customer's linked bank or credit union account after calling the API to initiate micro-deposits. Since the Sandbox environment doesn't replicate any bank transfer processes, any two amounts **below** `$0.10` will allow you to verify the funding source immediately. In Production, when the micro-deposits have finished processing, you will receive a `customer_microdeposits_completed` event. To trigger this event in Sandbox, you need to simulate bank transfer processing. Check out the [testing transfers](#testing-transfers) section for more information on how to simulate bank transfer processing in Sandbox.

### Test micro-deposit failed verification attempts

When verifying a funding source using the micro-deposit method of bank verification, users are allowed **three attempts** to correctly input the two posted micro-deposit amounts. If the user fails to verify the two posted amounts on the third attempt, an event will be triggered and the funding source will not be verified using those micro-deposit amounts. To simulate the `microdeposits_maxattempts` or `customer_microdeposits_maxattempts` events in the Sandbox, use the amounts `0.09` and `0.09` when calling the API to verify micro-deposits. Reference the [micro-deposit verification](/guides/micro-deposit-verification/verify-micro-deposits#handle-failed-verification-attempts) guide for more information on handling failed verification attempts.

### Test debit card numbers

Dwolla requires a valid card number to add a [debit card](/concepts/debit-cards). For testing purposes, you can use the following card numbers,

- Visa - `4111 1111 1111 1111`
- MasterCard - `5555 5555 5555 4444`

### Test debit card failures

To help you test error scenarios, an option can be used in the `Cardholder Name` field for the debit card you are trying to add.

##### List of options for testing Debit card errors

| Option               | Error message                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| pushfunds ineligible | The card is ineligible for push-to-card. |
| actioncode invalid   | The card could not be verified.          |
| cvv invalid          | The CVV or expiration date is invalid.   |
| address invalid      | The address is invalid.                  |
