# Getting started in Sandbox

## Sandbox environment

The Sandbox environment is a complete replica of the Dwolla production environment, supporting all of the same API endpoints. Applications should be tested against the Sandbox environment before being used in production.

### Differences from production environment

- The Sandbox contains only test data and is completely separate from your production account.
- All API endpoints have a base URL of `https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/` instead of `https://api.dwolla.com/`
- Actual money is not sent or received as part of test transactions.

### Transfer behavior in the Sandbox

Unlike transfers that are sourced from a Dwolla balance, which are processed instantaneously, bank-sourced transfers exist in the pending state for a few business days until they are `processed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.

The Sandbox environment does not replicate any ACH processes, so a `pending` transfer will not clear or fail automatically after a few business days as it would in production. It will simply remain in the `pending` state indefinitely. Reference our [testing resource article](/resources/testing.html) for more information on how-to simulate bank transfer processing in the Sandbox environment.

## Sandbox setup

To set up your Sandbox account, all we ask for is a valid email address. Once you agree to the Dwolla Developer Terms and Service, you will receive an email asking to verify your email address.

**Please note:** Failure to verify your email will result in a 401 HTTP status for all API calls with an error code of `InvalidAccountStatus`.

After email verification, your Sandbox account will be created and you'll be redirected to our Sandbox Dashboard at `https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/`. Here you can view your API key and secret and generate an OAuth access token. Dwolla will also associate a funding source, add \$5000 to the account balance, and create an application.

## Next Steps

Once you have a valid Sandbox account, you can start making calls to the API. To simplify development, learn about configuring and using our [SDKs](/pages/sdks.html). You can also jump straight into the [API docs](https://docs.dwolla.com/) or continue to our guides for step by step instructions for your appropriate funds flow.
