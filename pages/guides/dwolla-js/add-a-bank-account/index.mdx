# Add a bank using dwolla.js

Using dwolla.js, securely transmit sensitive data (bank account and routing number) to Dwolla without the data passing through your server. This resource guide will walk you through the process of generating a funding sources token, collecting the user's bank account information, and calling a JavaScript function to send this data to Dwolla. When you collect and submit the user's bank account information, dwolla.js has built-in validation that will trigger an error if any of the required fields are invalid.

### Getting Started: Initial configuration

#### Include dwolla.js

Begin the client-side implementation by including dwolla.js in the HEAD of your HTML page. You can include either the development version(`<script src="https://cdn.dwolla.com/1/dwolla.js"></script>`) or the minified version (`<script src="https://cdn.dwolla.com/1/dwolla.min.js"></script>`) of dwolla.js.

```html
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.dwolla.com/1/dwolla.js"></script>
</head>
```
