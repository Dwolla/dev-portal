# Step 4: Callback function - handling the error or response

The callback function (err, res) allows you to determine if there is an error with the request (e.g. `Routing number invalid.`) or if the response was successful. In the example above, we are displaying any error or response within a `logs` container on our page.

- If there is an error: Display the error to the user to have them correct any fields, and have them re-attempt to add their bank.
  - Example: `{"error":{"code":"ValidationError","message":"Validation error(s) present. See embedded errors list for more details.","_embedded":{"errors":[{"code":"Invalid","message":"Routing number invalid.","path":"/routingNumber"}]}}}`
- If successful: You will receive a JSON response that includes a link to the newly attached funding source.
  - Example: `{"error":null,"response":{"_links":{"funding-source":{"href":"https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/funding-sources/746d5c93-acb9-4826-a9c1-78ecf16401a6"}}}}`
