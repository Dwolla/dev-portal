# Personal Customer Verification

This guide will walk through the identity verification process for [personal verified Customers](/concepts/customer-types) within the Dwolla API.

A `personal` verified Customer represents an individual that intends to send or receive funds on your platform. In any transaction, at least one party—either the sender or the receiver—must complete the [identity verification](https://www.dwolla.com/updates/guide-to-cip-customer-identification-program-dwolla-payments-api/) process as outlined in this guide.
