# Personal verified Customer

## Create a personal verified Customer

To create a personal verified Customer, use the [create a Customer](https://docs.dwolla.com/#create-a-customer) endpoint. A personal verified Customer is determined by setting the value of the `type` request parameter to `personal` and including additional fields required for identifying the individual.

## Events

As a developer, you can expect these events to be triggered when a personal verified Customer is successfully created and systematically verified:

1. `customer_created`
2. `customer_verified`

## Required parameters - personal verified Customer

## Check the status of the personal verified Customer

The successful creation of a Customer doesn’t necessarily mean the Customer is verified and eligible to send or receive funds. When a Customer has been successfully verified by Dwolla, their status will be set to `verified`.

Let’s check to see if the Customer was successfully verified or not. We are going to use the location of the Customer resource that was just created, which is in `new_customer`.

```bash
GET https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/FC451A7A-AE30-4404-AB95-E3553FCD733F

## Next steps

Congrats! Our Customer was successfully verified!

However, if the Customer was unable to be verified on the initial flow, they will be given a verification status of either retry, kba, document, or suspended. Continue reading for instructions on [handling various Customer verification statuses](/guides/personal-verified-customer/handle-verification-statuses) and guidelines for providing additional information to verify these Customers.
