# Step 2: Adding Funding Sources

Within Dwolla, the sending party must always [verify their bank account](/guides/plaid) in order to be eligible to create a transfer.

## Bank Addition and Verification Methods

There are currently two ways of adding a bank to a Customer with the Dwolla API. A simplified table below outlines the similarities and differences of each method.

| Bank Addition Method                                                                                                       | Will the bank be verified?    | Required Information            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| API - Account & Routing Number                                                                                             | Optional - With Microdeposits | Bank Account and Routing Number |
| Third Party - Plaid Link ([Example](https://github.com/Dwolla/integration-examples/tree/main/dwolla-plaid-funding-source)) | Yes                           | Online Bank Credentials         |

## Step 2A: Add a Bank to a Verified Personal Customer

Next, you will create and attach a verified funding source to your Customer, which will be done using Plaid Link, a third-party bank verification provider. This method will give your Customers the ability to add and verify their bank account in a matter of seconds by authenticating using their online banking credentials.

Once your Customer reaches the page in your application to add a bank account, you will first use Plaid Link to authenticate the user's bank account, exchange the `public_token` for a `processor_token`, and then send the `processor_token` to Dwolla to create the funding source.

To integrate Dwolla with Plaid, we recommend checking out our [Add a Bank via Dwolla + Plaid Integration](/guides/plaid) guide. Additionally, if you would like to see a working example that creates a Dwolla funding source and instantly verifies it via Plaid Link (using Next.js/React), we recommend checking out our [dwolla-plaid-funding-source](https://github.com/Dwolla/integration-examples/blob/main/dwolla-plaid-funding-source) integration example on our GitHub profile.

## Step 2B: Handle Webhooks

Similar to creating a funding source manually and verifying it via microdeposits, when a funding source is created and instantly verified via Plaid Link, you will receive two webhooks: `customer_funding_source_added` and `customer_funding_source_verified`. The former is sent when the funding source is created, whereas the latter is sent when the funding source has been verified via your integration with Plaid.

## Step 2C: Add a Savings Account

Once you have integrated Dwolla with Plaid, and you have attached a customer's `checking` account, you will want to repeat the same steps outlined above to add the customer's `savings` account as a funding source as well.
