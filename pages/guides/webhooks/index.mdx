# Creating a Webhook Subscription

A webhook is a means of notifying a third-party application of the occurrence of an event with some relevant information. In the Dwolla API, webhooks are currently triggered by the following resources:

- Customers
- Documents
- Funding Sources
- Transfers
- Mass Payments

Each webhook sent by the Dwolla API contains an `Event` with `_links` to: the associated resource, account associated with the event, and the customer associated with the event (if applicable). It is important to note that a single API request can trigger multiple webhooks to be fired, e.g. initiating a transfer from an Account to Customer can create the events `transfer_created` and `customer_transfer_created`.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  Webhooks are sent asynchronously and are not guaranteed to be delivered in
  order. We recommend that applications protect against duplicated events by
  making event processing idempotent.
