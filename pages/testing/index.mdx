# Testing in the Sandbox

## Sandbox environment overview

The Sandbox environment is a complete replica of the Dwolla production environment, supporting all of the same API endpoints. Applications should be tested against the Sandbox environment before being used in production.

### Differences from production environment

- The Sandbox contains only test data and is completely separate from your production account.
- All API endpoints have a base URL of `https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/` instead of `https://api.dwolla.com/`
- Actual money is not sent or received as part of test transactions.

  Real financial data should never be used in the Sandbox.

### Transfer behavior in the Sandbox

Unlike transfers that are sourced from a [Dwolla balance](/concepts/balance-funding-source), which are processed instantaneously, bank-sourced transfers exist in the pending state for a few business days until they are `processed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.

The Sandbox environment does not replicate any ACH processes, so a `pending` transfer will not clear or fail automatically after a few business days as it would in production. It will simply remain in the `pending` state indefinitely. Reference the [testing transfers](/guides/sandbox/transfers) section for more information on how to simulate bank transfer processing in the Sandbox environment.

### Sandbox account setup

To set up your Sandbox account, all you will need is a valid email address. Once you agree to the Dwolla Developer Terms and Service, you will receive an email asking to verify your email address.

<AlertBar variation="warning">
  Failure to verify your email will result in a 401 HTTP status for all API
  calls with an error code of <code>InvalidAccountStatus</code>.
</AlertBar>

After email verification, your Sandbox account will be created and you'll be redirected to our Sandbox Dashboard at `https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/`. Here you can view your API key and secret and generate an OAuth access token. Dwolla will also create an application for your account, associate a funding source named 'Superhero Savings Bank', and add $5000 to the account balance for testing.
