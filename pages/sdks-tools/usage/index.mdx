# Node

### Getting Started

To begin using this SDK, you will first need to download and install it on your machine. We use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dwolla-v2) to distribute this package.

```shell
# npm
$ npm install --save dwolla-v2

# yarn
$ yarn add dwolla-v2

# pnpm
$ pnpm add dwolla-v2
```

### Initialization

Before any API requests can be made, you must first determine which environment you will be using, as well as fetch the application key and secret. To fetch your application key and secret, please visit one of the following links:

- Production: https://dashboard.dwolla.com/applications
- Sandbox: https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications

Finally, you can create an instance of `Client` with `key` and `secret` replaced with the application key and secret that you fetched from one of the aforementioned links, respectively.

```javascript
const Client = require("dwolla-v2").Client;

const dwolla = new Client({
  environment: "sandbox", // Defaults to "production"
  key: process.env.DWOLLA_APP_KEY,
  secret: process.env.DWOLLA_APP_SECRET,
});
```

## Making Requests

Once you've created a `Client`, currently, you can make low-level HTTP requests. High-level abstraction is planned for this SDK; however, at the time of writing, it has not yet been fully implemented.

### Low-Level Requests

To make low-level HTTP requests, you can use the [`get()`](#get), [`post()`](#post), and [`delete()`](#delete) methods. These methods will return a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) containing the response object.

The following snippet defines Dwolla's response object, both with a successful and errored response. Although the snippet uses [`try`/`catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch), you can also use [`.then()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then)/[`.catch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/catch) if you prefer.

An errored response is returned when Dwolla's servers respond with a status code that is greater than or equal to 400, whereas a successful response is when Dwolla's servers respond with a 200-level status code.

```javascript
try {
  const response = await dwolla.get("customers");
  // response.body      => Object or String depending on response type
  // response.headers   => Headers { ... }
  // response.status    => 200
} catch (error) {
  // error.body       => Object or String depending on response type
  // error.headers    => Headers { ... }
  // error.status     => 400
}
```

#### `GET`

```javascript
// GET https://api.dwolla.com/customers?offset=20&limit=10
const response = await dwolla.get("customers", {
  offset: 20,
  limit: 10,
});

console.log("Response Total: ", response.body.total);
```

#### `POST`

```javascript
// POST https://api.dwolla.com/customers body={ ... }
// This request is not idempotent since `Idempotecy-Key` is not passed as a header
const response = await dwolla.post("customers", {
  firstName: "Jane",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "jane.doe@example.com",
});

console.log("Created Resource: ", response.headers.get("Location"));

// POST https://api.dwolla.com/customers/{id}/documents multipart/form-data ...
// Note: Requires form-data peer dependency to be downloaded and installed
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("documentType", "license");
formData.append(
  "file",
  ffs.createReadStream("mclovin.jpg", {
    contentType: "image/jpeg",
    filename: "mclovin.jpg",
    knownLength: fs.statSync("mclovin.jpg").size,
  })
);

const response = await dwolla.post(`${customerUrl}/documents`, formData);
console.log("Created Resource: ", response.headers.get("Location"));
```

#### `DELETE`

```javascript
// DELETE https://api.dwolla.com/[resource]
await dwolla.delete("resource");
```

#### Setting Headers

When a request is sent to Dwolla, a few headers are automatically sent (e.g., `Accept`, `Content-Type`, `User-Agent`); however, if you would like to send additional headers, such as `Idempotency-Key`, this can be done by passing in a third (3rd) argument for `POST` requests.

To learn more about how to make your requests idempotent, check out our [developer documentation](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference#idempotency-key) on this topic!

```javascript
// POST https://api.dwolla.com/customers body={ ... }  headers={ ..., Idempotency-Key=... }
// This request is idempotent since `Idempotency-Key` is passed as a header
const response = await dwolla.post(
  "customers",
  {
    firstName: "Jane",
    lastName: "Doe",
    email: "jane.doe@example.com",
  },
  {
    "Idempotency-Key": "[RANDOMLY_GENERATED_KEY_HERE]",
  }
);
```

## Docker

If you prefer to use Docker to run dwolla-v2-node locally, a Dockerfile is included at the root directory.
Follow these instructions from [Docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/build/hellobuild/) to create a Docker image from the Dockerfile, and run it.

# Python

## Getting Started

### Installation

To begin using this SDK, you will first need to download it to your machine. We use [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dwollav2) to distribute this package from where you can automagically download it via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

```shell
$ pip install dwollav2
```

### Initialization

Before any API requests can be made, you must first determine which environment you will be using, as well as fetch the application key and secret. To fetch your application key and secret, please visit one of the following links:

- Production: https://dashboard.dwolla.com/applications
- Sandbox: https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications

Finally, you can create an instance of `Client` with `key` and `secret` replaced with the application key and secret that you fetched from one of the aforementioned links, respectively.

```python
client = dwollav2.Client(
  key = os.environ['DWOLLA_APP_KEY'],
  secret = os.environ['DWOLLA_APP_SECRET'],
  environment = 'sandbox', # defaults to 'production'
  requests = {'timeout': 0.001}
)
```

##### Configure an `on_grant` callback (optional)

An `on_grant` callback is useful for storing new tokens when they are granted. The `on_grant`
callback is called with the `Token` that was just granted by the server.

```python
client = dwollav2.Client(
  key = os.environ['DWOLLA_APP_KEY'],
  secret = os.environ['DWOLLA_APP_SECRET'],
  on_grant = lambda t: save(t)
)
```

It is highly recommended that you encrypt any token data you store.

#### Tokens

##### Generating New Access Tokens

Application access tokens are used to authenticate against the API on behalf of an application. Application tokens can be used to access resources in the API that either belong to the application itself (`webhooks`, `events`, `webhook-subscriptions`) or the Dwolla Account that owns the application (`accounts`, `customers`, `funding-sources`, etc.). Application tokens are obtained by using the [`client_credentials`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) OAuth grant type:

```python
application_token = client.Auth.client()
```

_Application access tokens are short-lived: 1 hour. They do not include a `refresh_token`. When it expires, generate a new one using `client.Auth.client()`._

##### Initializing Pre-Existing Tokens:

The [Dwolla Sandbox Dashboard](https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com/applications-legacy) allows you to generate tokens for your application. A `Token` can be initialized with the following attributes:

```python
client.Token(access_token = '...',
             expires_in = 123)
```

## Making Requests

Once you've created a `Token`, currently, you can make low-level HTTP requests.

### Low-level Requests

To make low-level HTTP requests, you can use the `get()`, `post()`, and `delete()` methods. These methods will return a `Response` object.

#### `GET`

```python
# GET api.dwolla.com/resource?foo=bar
token.get('resource', foo = 'bar')

# GET requests can also use objects as parameters
# GET api.dwolla.com/resource?foo=bar
token.get('resource', {'foo' = 'bar', 'baz' = 'foo'})
```

#### `POST`

```python
# POST api.dwolla.com/resource {"foo":"bar"}
token.post('resource', foo = 'bar')

# POST api.dwolla.com/resource multipart/form-data foo=...
token.post('resource', foo = ('mclovin.jpg', open('mclovin.jpg', 'rb'), 'image/jpeg'))
```

#### `DELETE`

```python
# DELETE api.dwolla.com/resource
token.delete('resource')
```

#### Setting headers

To set additional headers on a request you can pass a `dict` of headers as the 3rd argument.

For example:

```python
token.post('customers', { 'firstName': 'John', 'lastName': 'Doe', 'email': 'jd@doe.com' },
                        { 'Idempotency-Key': 'a52fcf63-0730-41c3-96e8-7147b5d1fb01' })
```

```python
res = token.get('/')

res.status
# => 200

res.headers
# => {'server'=>'cloudflare-nginx', 'date'=>'Mon, 28 Mar 2016 15:30:23 GMT', 'content-type'=>'application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json; charset=UTF-8', 'content-length'=>'150', 'connection'=>'close', 'set-cookie'=>'__cfduid=d9dcd0f586c166d36cbd45b992bdaa11b1459179023; expires=Tue, 28-Mar-17 15:30:23 GMT; path=/; domain=.dwolla.com; HttpOnly', 'x-request-id'=>'69a4e612-5dae-4c52-a6a0-2f921e34a88a', 'cf-ray'=>'28ac1f81875941e3-MSP'}

res.body['_links']['events']['href']
# => 'https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/events'
```

##### Error

If the server returns an error, a `dwollav2.Error` (or one of its subclasses) will be raised.
`dwollav2.Error`s are similar to `Response`s.

```python
try:
  token.get('/not-found')
except dwollav2.NotFoundError as e:
  e.status
  # => 404

  e.headers
  # => {"server"=>"cloudflare-nginx", "date"=>"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 15:35:32 GMT", "content-type"=>"application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json; profile=\"http://nocarrier.co.uk/profiles/vnd.error/\"; charset=UTF-8", "content-length"=>"69", "connection"=>"close", "set-cookie"=>"__cfduid=da1478bfdf3e56275cd8a6a741866ccce1459179332; expires=Tue, 28-Mar-17 15:35:32 GMT; path=/; domain=.dwolla.com; HttpOnly", "access-control-allow-origin"=>"*", "x-request-id"=>"667fca74-b53d-43db-bddd-50426a011881", "cf-ray"=>"28ac270abca64207-MSP"}

  e.body.code
  # => "NotFound"
except dwollav2.Error:
