# Knowledge-based Authentication (KBA)

Knowledge-based authentication, commonly referred to as KBA, is a method of authentication which seeks to prove the identity of an individual. KBA requires the knowledge of private information of the individual to prove that the person providing the identity information is the owner of the identity. Questions are compiled from public and private data such as marketing data, credit reports or transaction history.
