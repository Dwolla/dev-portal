# List business classifications

Retrieve an `_embedded` list of business classifications that contains an `_embedded` list of industry classifications. The appropriate Id from the list of industry classifications must be passed in the `businessClassification` parameter when [creating a Business Verified Customer](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/customers/create#verified-business-customer-businesstypellc-corporation-or-partnership---request-parameters). The industry classification is used to identify the Customer's business and is required by Dwolla when verifying a `business` in order to better analyze the nature of a business.
