# List and search customers

This section outlines how to retrieve your list of created Customers. This endpoint contains optional query string parameters allowing you to filter by `email` and `status`, as well as search on key fields such as `firstName`, `lastName`, and `businessName`.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.dwolla.com/customers`

### Pagination

By default, an embedded list of 25 customers are returned and are sorted by created timestamp. To page through the remaining list, you’ll specify a combination of `limit` and `offset` as query string parameters. Limit can have a max value of 200 customer objects. It is recommended to use the `_links` object in the response which includes the following relational links for paging. Check out the [Links](#links) section for more information.

- `next` includes the URL to list the next set of Customers as defined by Limit
- `prev` includes the URL to list the previous set of Customers as defined by Limit
- `first` includes the URL to list the first set of Customers as defined by Limit
- `last` includes the URL to list the last set of Customers as defined by Limit
- `self` link indicates the URL of the resource itself

##### Example HTTP Request

`GET https://api.dwolla.com/customers?limit=5&offset=25`

### Searching and filtering Customers

The `search` query string parameter contains a fuzzy search query across `firstName`, `lastName`, `businessName`, and `email` fields. Scoring is performed on the search term which looks for approximate spellings that match the entered search string and results are returned accordingly in an embedded customers array. **Note:** For exact match on `email` string value, the email filter should be used.

The `email` query string parameter is a filter that returns an embedded customers array based on an exact match of the filter value. For example, if you would like to search for a Customer with the email address “jane@email.com”, you can append the additional parameter `email` to the request URL as shown in the example HTTP request below. **Note:** The email filter string value must be URL-encoded.

The `status` query string parameter can be used to list an embedded customers array based on the status field. For example, if you would like to list all Customers that are in `document` status, you can append the additional parameter `status` to the request URL with the value "document". Check out all possible values listed in the table below.

##### Example Request URL using `email` filter

`GET https://api.dwolla.com/customers?email=jane%40email.com`

##### Example Request URL using `search`

`GET https://api.dwolla.com/customers?search=Jane`

##### Example Request URL using `status` filter

`GET https://api.dwolla.com/customers?status=document`
