# Labels

A **Label** represents a designated portion of funds within a [Verified Customer's](https://developers.dwolla.com/resources/account-types.html#verified-customer) balance. To create a label, you’ll specify the ID of a Verified Customer and an amount. Your application will maintain any other Label information or associations. Labels can be created, updated, and deleted. You can also list all Labels for a Verified Customer Record and list all entries for a specified Label. Note that a Verified Customer’s labeled amounts cannot exceed the balance available in such Verified Customer's account.
