# Funding Sources

The Funding Sources resource represents payment accounts that can be used to send and/or receive funds. Funding sources are relational to either a [Dwolla Master Account](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/accounts/create-a-funding-source) or [Customer](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/funding-sources/create-funding-source-for-customer) and can be used to reference details on a payment account.

### Funding source types

The four funding source types available with a Dwolla integration include a `bank`, the Dwolla `balance`, a `virtual` account number, and a debit `card`. Type `bank` represents any bank account attached as a funding source to Account and Customer resources. Type `balance` represents the Dwolla Balance made available to Account and Verified Customer resources. Type `virtual` represents a Virtual Account Number (VAN) funding source which can be used outside of the Dwolla Platform to route ACH payments both to and from a Dwolla Balance. Type `card` represents a reloadable prepaid or bank-issued debit card that can be used as a funding source type to receive funds in near real-time.

##### Bank funding source

Funding sources of type `bank` include an additional attribute, `bankAccountType`, denoting the type of the bank account being attached. The bank account types currently supported by Dwolla include `checking`, `savings`, `general-ledger` and `loan`.

- `checking`, `savings` - Checking and savings accounts can be attached to any Customer type. These account types are enabled for all Accounts and Customers, by default.

- `general-ledger` - General ledger accounts can only be attached to exempt Business Verified Customers. **Note**: Enabling this account type requires additional Dwolla approvals before getting started. Please contact [Sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs) or your account manager for more information on enabling this account type.

- `loan` - Loan accounts can only be attached to Verified Customers. These funding-sources can only be credited, meaning funds can only be sent to these accounts. **Note**: Enabling this account type requires additional Dwolla approvals before getting started. Please contact [Sales](https://www.dwolla.com/contact?b=apidocs) or your account manager for more information on enabling this account type.

##### Balance funding source

The [Dwolla Balance](https://developers.dwolla.com/concepts/balance-funding-source) can be utilized as a digital "wallet", storing USD funds for the Customer or Account with Dwolla’s financial institution partners. Additionally, the Dwolla Balance can be pre-loaded with funds for quicker outgoing ACH transfers to destination funding sources. To get a more in-depth overview of the Dwolla Balance, including functionality and other benefits, check out our [developer resource article](https://developers.dwolla.com/concepts/balance-funding-source) or view our [webinar](https://www.dwolla.com/resources/balance-webinar/).

##### Virtual account funding source

The Virtual Account Number, or `VAN`, is a funding source that upon creation contains both an account number and routing number which can be utilized outside of the Dwolla Platform to route ACH payments both to and from a Dwolla Balance. VANs cannot be used as a source or destination in `POST` requests to the `/transfers` endpoint as they can only be associated with activity that originates from outside of the Dwolla Platform. Because a `VAN` behaves as a route to a Dwolla balance, only Master Dwolla Accounts and [Verified Customers](https://developers.dwolla.com/concepts/customer-types#customer-types) are eligible to create a `VAN` funding source.

##### Card funding source

Adding a debit `card` as a funding source type allows your [Customers](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/customers) to receive funds typically within 30 minutes rather than hours or days. By sending funds from your Master Dwolla Balance funding source, you can directly “push” these funds out in near real-time to a customer’s reloadable prepaid card or bank-issued debit card. To get a more in-depth overview of debit `cards`, including functionality and other benefits, check out our [developer resource article](https://developers.dwolla.com/concepts/debit-cards).
