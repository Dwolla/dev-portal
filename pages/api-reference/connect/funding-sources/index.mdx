# Funding Sources

The Funding Sources resource represents payment accounts that can be used to send and/or receive funds. Funding sources are relational to either the main [Dwolla Account](/api-reference/connect/funding-sources/create) or an <span><ContentTooltip preset="external-party" href="https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/connect/funding-sources/create-for-external-party">External Party</ContentTooltip></span> and can be used to reference details on a payment account.

### Bank Account Types

Funding sources include an attribute, `bankAccountType`, which denotes the type of the bank account being attached. The bank account types currently supported by Dwolla include `checking` and `savings`.
