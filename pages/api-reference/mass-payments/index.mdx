# Mass payments

Dwolla mass payments allows you to easily send up to 5,000 payments in one API request. The payments are funded from a single user's specified funding source and processed asynchronously upon submission.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  Dwolla Mass Payments are meant for batches of multiple payments. If you are
  initiating a single payment to a singular Customer, we recommend using our
  <a href="/api-reference/transfers">transfers endpoint</a>.
</AlertBar>

Your mass payment will initially be pending and then processed. As the service processes your mass payment, each `item` is processed one after the other, at a rate between 0.5 sec. - 1 sec. / item. Therefore, you can expect a 1000-item mass payment to be completed between 8-16 minutes.

A mass payment offers a significant advantage over repeatedly calling the [Transfers](#transfers) endpoint for each individual transaction. A key benefit is that a bank-funded mass payment only incurs a single ACH debit from the bank account to fund the entire batch of payments. The alternative approach will incur an ACH debit from the bank funding source for each individual payment. Those who used this approach have reported incurring fees from their financial institutions for excessive ACH transactions.
