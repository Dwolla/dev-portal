# Operational Notifications

When using Dwolla’s white-label API, your application is responsible for all interactions to your end users. You decide how to customize the payments experience end-to-end, which includes taking on the required delivery of notifications to end users for their account and payment activity. By default, Dwolla provides functionality via Operational Notifications and sends email notifications to your end users on your behalf. When actions occur within the Dwolla Network on a resource (Customers, Transfers, etc.), events are created to record those changes. Dwolla systematically delivers an email using the email address tied to the [creation of a Customer](https://docs.dwolla.com/#customers) when an applicable event occurs.

## Operational Notification Events

Email notifications are sent to your end users when they complete the activities focused on the following key functions in your application (powered by the Dwolla Platform) or via the Dwolla Dashboard:

- Customer creation
- Bank account management and validation
- Money added to a balance
- Money withdrawn from a balance
- Money sent to another end user (or your company)
- Money received from another end user (or your company)
- Customer verification and suspension

A full list of events are listed below. Please review to ensure you know when your users will receive notifications via Operational Notifications. In addition to the email notifications listed in this article, further communications, per Dwolla’s requirements and your own application’s functionality, will need to be sent by you to your end users. Please contact your Integration Manager with questions specific to your integration and recommended (or required) emails.

## Customization
