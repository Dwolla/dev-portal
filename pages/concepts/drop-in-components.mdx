# UI Components Library

Dwolla’s UI components library allows developers to leverage isolated functions or build connected flows in their web applications, which expedites the integration process with the Dwolla Platform. Each component within this library includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript that developers can drop-in and customize to fit the look and feel of their application.

The library comes with a collection of low-code components that solve for a variety of functions and flows including: create a customer, document upload, balance display, as well as a connected flow for accepting incoming payments from a user.

Each component contains built-in features such as responsive design, custom styling, error handling and more. These components allow developers to ship more with fewer lines of code— while improving readability and maintainability of their application’s code.

Dwolla also maintains React bindings for all supported components. As the library continues to grow, Dwolla will evaluate adding support for other frameworks and languages based on feedback from the community.

## Workflow

Use of Dwolla components requires both client-side and server-side interaction between your application and Dwolla. A unique “client token” is generated with limited permissions to be used in the components library to authenticate requests to Dwolla.

A quick overview of the steps involved:

1. On your application’s front-end, the Dwolla components library is instantiated and configured. One or many components are dropped into the web page where they will be rendered.
2. A request is sent from your front-end to your back-end server to generate a client-token. Using a server-side SDK, you’ll specify the “action” needed for the component and the unique Customer ID that represents the end user performing the action.
3. Your server sends the generated client token back to your front-end which is used by the components library to authenticate the client-side request to Dwolla.
4. Your end user interacts with the Dwolla Component, either directly via submission of information in a form (e.g. upgrade customer), or indirectly by viewing data (e.g. balance display).

## Drop-in Component Example

Dwolla’s Drop-in UI Components are customizable to match the look and feel of your application down to the individual HTML element by applying styles via custom CSS classes. Preview the create an Unverified Customer component below, or refer to the [drop-ins examples repo](https://github.com/Dwolla/drop-ins-examples) to view a list of all drop-in component examples.

## Supported Components

Dwolla's UI components library contains a variety of supported components that represent isolated functions or connected flows. Each component requires a unique “client-token” and Customer ID for the end-user that is performing the action in your web application. This section outlines the complete list of supported components which includes: the component name, css classes for customization, and the required client-token action.

This information includes: First Name, Last Name, Email, Optionally: Business Name for Businesses. To find out more about the abilities and limitations of this customer type, [visit our docs](/concepts/customer-types) on concepts.
