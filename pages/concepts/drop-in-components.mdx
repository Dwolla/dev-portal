# Dwolla Drop-in Components Library

Dwolla’s drop-in components library allows developers to leverage isolated functions or build connected flows in their web applications, which expedites the integration process with the Dwolla Platform. Each component within Dwolla’s drop-in components library includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript that developers can drop-in and customize to fit the look and feel of their application.

The library comes with a collection of low-code components that solve for a variety of functions and flows including: create a customer, document upload, balance display, as well as a connected flow for accepting incoming payments from a user.

Each drop-in component contains built-in features such as responsive design, custom styling, error handling and more. These components allow developers to ship more with fewer lines of code— while improving readability and maintainability of their application’s code.

This is a language-agnostic library, meaning that any webpage that supports client-side JavaScript will support drop-in components! For ease of use, however, we also offer [JSX/TSX bindings](https://github.com/Dwolla/react-drop-ins) if you are developing using React or a React-based environment (such as Next). As the library continues to grow, Dwolla will evaluate adding support for other frameworks based on community feedback.

## Workflow

Use of Dwolla’s drop-in components requires client-side and server-side interaction between your application and Dwolla. A unique “client token” is generated with limited permissions to be used in the components library to authenticate requests to Dwolla.

A quick overview of the steps involved:

1. On your application’s front-end, the Dwolla components library is instantiated and configured. One or many components are dropped into the web page where they will be rendered.
2. A request is sent from your front-end to your back-end server to generate a client-token. Using a server-side SDK, you’ll specify the “action” needed for the component and the unique Customer ID that represents the end user performing the action.
3. Your server sends the generated client token back to your front-end which is used by the components library to authenticate the client-side request to Dwolla.
4. Your end user interacts with the Dwolla Component, either directly via submission of information in a form (e.g. upgrade customer), or indirectly by viewing data (e.g. balance display).

## Drop-in Component Example

Dwolla’s drop-in components are customizable to match the look and feel of your application down to the individual HTML element by applying styles via custom CSS classes. Preview the create an Unverified Customer component below, or refer to the [drop-ins examples repo](https://github.com/Dwolla/drop-ins-examples) to view a list of all drop-in component examples.

## Supported Components

Dwolla's UI components library contains a variety of supported components that represent isolated functions or connected flows. Each component requires a unique “client-token” and Customer ID for the end user that is performing the action in your web application. This section outlines the complete list of supported components which includes: the component name, css classes for customization, and the required client-token action.

  feature, the interaction between the API and the customer must happen outside
  of the drop-ins component library at this time.
</AlertBar>

### Pay-In

The `Pay-In` component can be used when transferring from a Customer's verified funding source into your own Dwolla Client funding source.

In order to utilize this component, you will first need to have a Customer with a verified funding source. This customer can be of type Unverified, Personal or Business Verified Customer.

In order to add a funding source and verify it, you can:

- [Add a bank](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/dwolla-js/add-a-bank-account#add-a-bank-using-dwollajs) with an account and routing number, and afterward verify it with [microdeposits](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/micro-deposit-verification#verify-a-bank-account-with-micro-deposits)
- Add and verify a bank with [Dwolla + Plaid integration](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/plaid#plaid-integration)

[Create client-token](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/drop-in-components/create-client-token) action: `customer.transfers.send`

## Next steps

Leveraging Dwolla’s UI Components library is a great way to expedite your integration with the Dwolla Platform by limiting the amount of custom code that you would be required to write.

Get started building with drop-in components by checking out the [getting started guide](/guides/drop-ins) and the [API Reference documentation](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/drop-in-components).

## Changelog

### Latest `v2.2.0`

The latest version of **dwolla-web.js** is `2.2.0`. If you are currently using `v2`, we recommend [upgrading](/guides/drop-ins/setup-and-configuration#include-dwolla-webjs) to `2.2.0`.

- Added `<dwolla-funding-source-create>` drop-in component
- Added `<dwolla-micro-deposits-verify>` drop-in component
- Updated `dwolla.configure` `token` callback function to receive `{ _links, action, links }`, rather than just `{ action, links }`. This will allow immediate pass-through without modification to the Dwolla API while maintaining backwards compatibility for existing implementations.

### `v2.1.9`

- Fixed `Submit` button double-click issue on customer creation drop-ins.
- Improve SSN field validation.
- Added optional `hideZeroBalance` attribute to `<dwolla-balance-display>` drop-in.
- Added new Account Opening drop-in `<dwolla-account-opening>`.

### `v2.1.8`

- Added optional `correlationId` field to `<dwolla-customer-create>`, `<dwolla-business-vcr>` and `<dwolla-personal-vcr>` drop-ins.
- Added optional `businessName` field to `<dwolla-customer-create>` drop-in.
- Added optional `hideDBAField` attribute to `<dwolla-business-vcr>` drop-in.
- Made `EIN` optional in the `<dwolla-business-vcr>` drop-in for Business Verified Customers of type Sole Proprietorship.
- All components are now flow-type components requiring multiple calls to the `client-tokens` endpoint for granularly scoped actions.
- Implemented hard-versioning of dwolla-web.js; to use the latest version, you will need to import the exact version rather than just the major version using the CDN script.

### `v2.1.6`

- Changed `success` callback response structure. In previous versions, upon successful creation of a resource, the `location` of the newly created resource is returned. In v2.1.6 and onwards, the success JSON response will contain a top-level `resource` and a `response` object with the location to the newly created resource.

```raw
# Used to be:
{
   "location":"https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/c81cf726-77ff-4a2a-bfde-1fb1fb90cefd"
}



# Changed to:
{
   "resource":"customers",
   "response":{
      "location":"https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/c81cf726-77ff-4a2a-bfde-1fb1fb90cefd"
   }
}
```
