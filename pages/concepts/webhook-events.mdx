# Webhook Events

When an action occurs within the Dwolla system on a resource (Customers, Transfers, etc.), an Event object is created to record a change to the state of the resource. All created Webhook Events follow the same format and include high level details such as: an event topic, a resource URL that identifies the specific resource that changed states, and a timestamp. If your application has an active [webhook subscription](/guides/webhooks/create-subscription/), all Events relevant to your integration will trigger a webhook notification each time they occur. The following resource article will provide guidance on the structure of webhook events, which will assist with handling incoming webhooks.

  Dwolla requires all applications to have a created webhook subscription in
  production. The webhook subscription is used to notify your application to
  trigger an email notification to your end-users.

## Webhook request details

When your webhook subscription is configured, events will be created and sent asynchronously via webhooks as they occur. The webhook notification from Dwolla is a POST request that contains a JSON-encoded payload as well as HTTP headers, which are both used when consuming the webhook. Webhook payloads are designed to be lightweight with only minimum details regarding the triggered event. Dwolla returns links within the Event object pointing to relevant resources in the API which are used to lookup more detailed information on the resource that changed states.

## Webhook headers

There are a few HTTP headers that are useful for your application when consuming the webhook request. `x-dwolla-topic` lets your app know, at a high level, the type of event being sent in the payload. `x-request-signature-sha256` contains a HMAC SHA256 hash based on the webhook payload and a key which is your webhook secret. The webhook signature should be [validated](/guides/webhooks/validating-webhooks) prior to parsing the webhook payload.

- `x-dwolla-topic` - customer_created
- `x-request-signature-sha-256` - ed551cfb4acb48d31e14886bffa33aa417dfa4a3d3778f6141a7f7f92ee64861

## Webhook payload

All webhook payloads will include an Event object which will follow the same format as outlined in the [API reference docs](https://docs.dwolla.com/#events). An Event contains `_links` to: the relevant resource that caused the Event to be triggered, the Customer that the Event belongs to, and a `self` link to identify the unique Event. In addition to relevant `_links`, the payload will include attributes such as a created timestamp, event topic, and resourceId.

| \_links    | An object that contains relevant links to resources in the Dwolla API. Possible links can include: `self`, `account`, `resource`, and `customer`. <br /> `self` - a link to the unique event <br /> `account` - a link to the Dwolla account that the application belongs to <br /> `resource` - a link to the resource that changed states.

## List of supported events by resource

Webhooks are available for the list of Events shown below. As API enhancements are made, Dwolla may add new Events at any point in the future.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  The Event topic for all events triggered for your end-users that are created
  as Customers will be prepended with <code>customer_*</code>. Events that
  represent actions being triggered on your primary Dwolla Account are not shown
  below. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.dwolla.com/#events">API docs</a> for
