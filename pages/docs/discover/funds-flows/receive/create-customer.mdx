# Step 1: Creating your Customer

## Choose the Customer Type for your Funds Flow

Before your end user can send funds, they must be created as a Customer via the Dwolla API. The pay-ins funds flow is flexible in terms of choosing a Customer type to onboard, as both the `unverified` Customer and `verified` Customer types are eligible to send funds. To learn more on the different Customer types and the capabilities of each, check out our [customer types resource article](https://developers.dwolla.com/articles/customers).

## Step 1A. Create the Customer

While you can use the `verified` Customer type in this funds flow, we will be creating an `unverified` Customer in this guide.

#### Request Parameters - Unverified Customer

| Parameter     | Required? | Type   | Description              |
|---------------|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| firstName     | yes       | string | Customer's first name    |
| lastName      | yes       | string | Customer's last name     |
| email         | yes       | string | Customer's email address |
| businessName  | conditional       | string | Customer's registered business name (optional if not a business entity) |
| ipAddress     | no        | string | Customer's IP address    |

```php
<?php
$customersApi = new DwollaSwagger\CustomersApi($apiClient);

$customer = $customersApi->create([
  'firstName' => 'Jane',
  'lastName' => 'Merchant',
  'email' => 'jmerchant@nomail.net',
  'ipAddress' => '99.99.99.99'

      Provide the IP address of the end-user accessing your application as the `ipAddress` parameter. This enhances fraud detection and tracking.
    </li>
</ol>

When the Customer is successfully created by your application, you will receive a `201` HTTP response with an empty response body. You can reference the Location header to retrieve a link that represents the created Customer resource. We recommend storing the full URL for future use, as it will be necessary to complete additional  actions, such as attaching a bank or correlating webhooks that are triggered for the end user in the Dwolla system.

## Step 1B. Handle Webhooks

If you have an active webhook subscription, you will receive the `customer_created` webhook immediately after the resource has been created.
