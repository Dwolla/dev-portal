# Step 1: Creating your Customer

## Choose the Customer Type for Your Funds Flow

Before your end-user can send or receive funds to their connected bank account, they must be created as a Customer via the Dwolla API. With this funds flow, however, the only eligible Customer types are:

- Verified Personal Customers
- Verified Business Customers

To learn more on the differences between personal and business verified Customers and the capabilities of each, [check out our developer resource article.](https://developers.dwolla.com/articles/customers)

**A note on verified Customers:**

Verified Customers must go through the identity verification process and have a `verified` status in order to be eligible to transact. In order to verify the identity of the individual or business creating a Dwolla Customer account, you will need to pass information including, but not limited to, social security number (ssn), address, date of birth, and/or Employer Identification Number (EIN).

## Step 1A. Create the Customer

While both the Personal and Business verified Customer types are valid in this funds flow, we will be creating a Personal verified Customer in this guide.

```

When the Customer is successfully created on your application, you will receive a `201` HTTP response with an empty response body. You can reference the Location header to retrieve a link that represents the created Customer resource. We recommend storing the full URL for future use, as it will be needed for actions such as attaching a bank or correlating webhooks that are triggered for the user in the Dwolla system.

<ol class = "alerts">
    <li class="alert icon-alert-alert">
      Provide the IP address of the end-user accessing your application as the `ipAddress` parameter. This enhances fraud detection and tracking.
    </li>
</ol>

## Step 1B: Handle Webhooks

If you have an active webhook subscription, you will receive the `customer_created` and `customer_verified` webhook immediately after the resource has been created.

## Other expected behavior

### Customer Statuses

Not all Customers will have a `verified` status upon initial Customer creation. In production, you may run into an instance where more information is needed from your end-user in order for Dwolla to fully verify their identity. Other statuses your Customer may be placed in include, `retry`, `document`, `deactivated`, or `suspended`. For more information on these statuses, refer to our developer resource article.

### Balance Funding Source

On successful Customer verification, Dwolla will also create a [Balance Funding Source](https://developers.dwolla.com/articles/funding-sources/balance-funding-sources) for this Customer.

**A Note on the Balance Funding Source**

There are two types of Funding Sources available within the Dwolla Platform which include a bank or a balance. A bank account is commonly used as the source or destination for ACH transfers. A `balance` is a Funding Source that can be utilized like a “wallet” for holding a stored value of funds. The Dwolla balance is made available for Customers that have fully `verified` their identity within Dwolla.
