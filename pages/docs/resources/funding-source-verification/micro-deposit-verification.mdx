# Funding source verification

## Micro-deposit verification

If you choose the micro-deposit method of bank verification, Dwolla will transfer two deposits of less than \$0.10 to your customer's linked bank or credit union account. After [initiating micro-deposits](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#initiate-micro-deposits), two random amounts will post to your customer’s bank account in 1-2 business days. Once your customer sees these deposits in their account, they need to verify the two amounts in your application. If subscribed to [webhooks](/guides/webhooks), your application will be notified throughout this process via micro-deposit related [events](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#events).

### Retrieve the funding source

After your customer has added a bank account you'll want to retrieve the funding source to check if a `initiate-micro-deposits` link relation exists. A link to `initiate-micro-deposits` will return when an unverified `bank` funding source is eligible to receive micro-deposits.

### Initiate micro-deposits

Once you POST to the [initiate-micro-deposits](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#initiate-micro-deposits) link, Dwolla will send two small amounts to your customer's bank or credit union account. If the request is successful, Dwolla returns a `HTTP 201` and a link to the created micro-deposits resource `funding-sources/{id}/micro-deposits` in the location header. The micro-deposits resource can be later used to retrieve the status of micro-deposits or verify micro-deposit amounts. If your application is subscribed to webhooks, a webhook will be sent with the `microdeposits_added` event, notifying your application that micro-deposits are en route to your customer’s bank account.

```bash

```

```php
<?php
$fsApi = new DwollaSwagger\FundingsourcesApi($apiClient);
$micro_deposits = $fsApi->micro_deposits($retrieved);
?>
```

### Verify micro-deposits

In the Dwolla production environment, you must wait until the micro-deposits actually post to the customer’s bank account before the account can be verified, which can take 1-2 business days. A `microdeposits_completed` event will be triggered once micro-deposits have successfully posted to the bank. Once micro-deposits have completed, a `verify-micro-deposits` link relation will return on the funding source letting your application know the funding source can be verified.

**Note**: In the Sandbox environment, any amount **below** \$0.10 will allow you to verify the account immediately.

### Handle failed verification attempts

Your customer will have only three attempts to correctly input the two posted micro-deposit amounts. If your customer reaches the max attempts allowed, a `microdeposits_maxattempts` [event](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#events) will be triggered and they will no longer be allowed to verify the funding source using those same two posted micro-deposit amounts. In order to retry bank account verification via micro-deposits, the following steps will need to be taken by your customer and application:

1. [Removal of the funding source](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#remove-a-funding-source) with failed micro-deposit verification attempts.
2. Wait 48 hours after the initial funding source was added to re-add the funding source.
3. Initiate new micro-deposits to the funding source.
4. Verify the funding source using the new posted micro-deposit amounts.

Links returned on the funding source resource, either `initiate-micro-deposits` or `verify-micro-deposits`, will give your application insight into whether the funding source is eligible to receive or verify micro-deposits.
