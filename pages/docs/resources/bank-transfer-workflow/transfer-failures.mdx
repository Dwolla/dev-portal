# Bank transfer workflow

## Transfer failures

There are several reasons bank transfers can fail, a few of which are outlined below. When a transfer fails it is usually a result of an ACH failure which is assigned an ACH return code after being rejected from the financial institution. A few common failure cases include:

- **Insufficient Funds (R01):** Pending transfers can fail due to insufficient funds from the source bank account.
- **No Account/Unable to Locate Account (R03):** The recipient of a transfer has closed their bank account or has incorrectly entered their bank account/routing number when attaching their funding source.
- **Customer Advises Not Authorized (R10):** The owner of a bank account has told their bank that this transfer was unauthorized.

### What occurs in the Dwolla system when a bank transfer fails?

When a bank transfer failure occurs there are a subset of systematic actions Dwolla may take on the `Customer` and/or `Funding Source` based on the ACH return code. It is recommended to have an active [webhook subscription](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#create-a-webhook-subscription), which is used to listen for events relating to any Customer or Funding Source state change. Please refer to the table below to understand the systematic actions that Dwolla may take for Customer and Funding Source resources, as well as the events that are created.

| Customer action                                                         | Funding Source action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| &#8226; **none** <br/> &#8226; **deactivated** - `customer_deactivated` | &#8226; **none** <br/> &#8226; **unverified** - `customer_funding_source_unverified` <br/> &#8226; **removed** - `customer_funding_source_removed` <br/> &#8226; **unverified** - `customer_funding_source_unverified` and **removed** - `customer_funding_source_removed` |

### Retrieving the reason for a failed bank transfer

When a bank transfer fails its status will be updated to `failed`. If your application is subscribed to webhooks, you’ll receive either the `transfer_failed` event if the transfer belongs to a Dwolla account or the `customer_transfer_failed`/`customer_bank_transfer_failed`(_Verified Customer only_) event if the transfer belongs to an Access API Customer. The event contains a links to the associated account as well as the transfer resource. To obtain more information on the transfer failure, you’ll first retrieve the transfer by its ID. The response from the API when retrieving the transfer should contain a `"failure"` link that your application will follow to [retrieve the transfer failure reason](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#retrieve-a-transfer-failure-reason). Upon success, the response will contain information on the ACH return code and description, as well as `_links` to the Funding Source and Customer that triggered the bank transfer failure.
