# Step 1: Obtain authorization

To subscribe to webhooks, you must first obtain client authorization via OAuth. You will be requesting these credentials on the behalf of your own application, so there will be no OAuth permissions dialog; you are only required to provide your `client_id` and `client_secret`.

To generate an application access token, you'll need to initiate a POST request to `https://sandbox.dwolla.com/oauth/v2/token` in our Sandbox environment or `https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/v2/token` in our production environment. The request must include a `Content-Type` header with the value of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

**NOTE**: Currently, the Dwolla/Swagger SDKs do not contain the capability to do this, so you must use an external REST client.

#### Example request

```bash
POST https://sandbox.dwolla.com/oauth/v2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=CGQXLrlfuOqdUYdTcLz3rBiCZQDRvdWIUPkwasGMuGhkem9Bo&client_secret=g7QLwvO37aN2HoKx1amekWi8a2g7AIuPbD5CcJSLqXIcDOxfTr&grant_type=client_credentials
```

```python
# Using dwollav2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-python
# This example assumes you've already intialized the client. Reference the SDKs page for more information: https://developers.dwolla.com/pages/sdks.html
application_token = client.Auth.client()
```

```javascript
// Using DwollaV2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-node
// This example assumes you've already intialized the client. Reference the SDKs page for more information: https://developers.dwolla.com/pages/sdks.html
client.auth
  .client()
  .then(function(appToken) {
    return appToken.get("webhook-subscriptions");
  })
  .then(function(res) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(res.body));
  });
```

```ruby
# Using DwollaV2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-ruby
# This example assumes you've already intialized the client. Reference the SDKs page for more information: https://developers.dwolla.com/pages/sdks.html
application_token = $dwolla.auths.client
# => #<DwollaV2::Token client=#<DwollaV2::Client id="..." secret="..." environment=:sandbox> access_token="..." expires_in=3600 scope="...">
```
