# Handling verification statuses

After successfully creating a personal identity-verified `Customer`, they will immediately be given a status. There are various reasons a Customer status can be something other than `verified`; you will want to account for this after the Customer is created.

A Customer’s verification status is determined by an identity verification score based on the data submitted; this score is returned from Dwolla’s identity vendor. Therefore, it is important that the user enters accurate and complete identifying data, and that you exercise [best practices](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet) in input field validation to ensure the best possible success rate. As an example, the `retry` status can occur when an individual mis-keys or uses incorrect identifying information upon Customer creation (i.e. submitting a date of birth that differs from the user’s actual date of birth).

It is recommended to have an active [webhook subscription](https://docs.dwolla.com/#webhook-subscriptions) to listen for Customer verification related events. Reference the table below for Customer verification statuses and the related events.

### Verification statuses

| Customer status | Event                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| verified        | customer_verified                     | The identifying information submitted was sufficient in verifying the Customer account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| retry           | customer_reverification_needed        | The initial identity verification attempt failed because the information provided did not satisfy Dwolla’s verification check. You can make one additional attempt by changing some or all the attributes of the existing Customer with a POST request. All fields are required on the retry attempt. If the additional attempt fails, the resulting status will be either `document` or `suspended`. |
| kba             | customer_kba_verification_needed      | The retry identity verification attempt failed due insufficient scores on the submitted data. The end-user will have a single kba attempt to answer a set of “out of wallet” questions about themselves for identity verification.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| document        | customer_verification_document_needed | Dwolla requires additional documentation to identify the Customer in the document status. Once a document is uploaded it will be reviewed for verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Testing verification statuses in Sandbox

Dwolla’s Sandbox environment allows you to submit `verified`, `retry`, `kba`, `document`, or `suspended` as the value of the firstName parameter to create a new verified Customer with their respective status. To simulate transitioning a verified Customer with a `retry` status to `verified`, you’ll need to call the [Update a Customer](https://docs.dwolla.com/#update-a-customer) endpoint and submit full identifying information with an updated firstName value and full SSN. To simulate transitioning a verified Customer with a `document` status to `verified` in the Sandbox, you’ll need to upload a test document as outlined in the [Testing in the Sandbox](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/testing/customers/) resource article.

## Handling status: `retry`

A `retry` status occurs when a Customer’s identity scores are too low during the initial verification attempt. Dwolla will require the **full 9-digits** of the individual's SSN on the retry attempt in order to give our identity vendor more information in an attempt to receive a sufficient score to approve the Customer account. The Customer will have one more opportunity to correct any mistakes. **Please note:** you need to gather **new** information if the Customer is placed into the `retry` status; simply passing the same information will result in the same insufficient scores. All fields that were required in the initial Customer creation attempt will be required in the retry attempt, along with the full 9-digit SSN.

), $customerUrl);

print($retryCustomer->id); # => 132681fa-1b4d-4181-8ff2-619ca46235b1
?>
```

Check the Customer’s status again. The Customer will either be in the `verified`, `document`, or `suspended` state of verification.

## Handling status: `kba`

A kba status occurs when a Customer’s identity scores are too low after the retry verification attempt. Knowledge based authentication (KBA), is used to identify end-users by asking them to answer specific security questions pulled from a set of known data about themselves. These questions are also known as “out of wallet” questions which are dynamically generated on the spot. The Customer must answer at least three out of four total questions correctly in order to pass verification, which translates to a score of 75%. If the user fails to pass kba verification they will be placed in a `document` status. The KBA flow is a three step process which includes: initiating the KBA session, retrieving the question set, and answering the question set.

> [Learn more](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/testings) on testing KBA in the Sandbox environment.

### Initiating the KBA session

The first step in the KBA flow is to make a request to the Dwolla API to [generate a unique KBA ID](https://docs.dwolla.com/#kba) which is used to represent the KBA session.

### Request and response

[CODE EXAMPLE HERE]

### Retrieve KBA Question set

Once the KBA ID is created, your application will have a **single attempt** to [retrieve](https://link-to-api-docs) and [answer](https://link-to-api-docs) the question set returned from the Dwolla API. Upon a successful request to retrieve the question set, your end-user will have two minutes to complete the submission of their selected answers.

### Request and response

[CODE EXAMPLE HERE]

### Answer KBA Questions

Questions and answers will have their own unique identifiers. Questions and answers are submitted via an `answers` array that contains a list of four JSON objects that include key-value pairs for specifying a questionId and answerId.

### Request and response

[CODE EXAMPLES HERE]

## Handling status: `document`

If the Customer has a status of `document`, the Customer will need to upload additional pieces of information in order to verify the account. Use the [create a document](https://docs.dwolla.com/#create-a-document) endpoint when uploading a colored scan of the identifying document. The document(s) will then be reviewed by Dwolla; this review may take up to 1-2 business days to approve or reject.

### Document types

A color scanned photo of the Customer's identifying document can be specified as documentType: `passport`, `license` (state issued driver's license), or `idCard` (other U.S. government-issued photo id card).

When a Customer is placed in the `document` verification status, Dwolla will return a link in the API response after [retrieving a Customer](https://docs.dwolla.com/#retrieve-a-customer) which will be used by an application to determine if documentation is needed.

| Link name            | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| verify-with-document | Identifies if documents are needed only for an individual |

### Uploading a document

To upload a color photo of the document, you’ll initiate a multipart form-data POST request from your backend server to `https://api.dwolla.com/customers/{id}/documents`. The file must be either a .jpg, .jpeg, .png, or .pdf. Files must be no larger than 10MB in size.

```bash
curl -X POST
\ -H "Authorization: Bearer tJlyMNW6e3QVbzHjeJ9JvAPsRglFjwnba4NdfCzsYJm7XbckcR"
\ -H "Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json"

If the document was successfully uploaded, the response will be a HTTP 201 Created with the URL of the new document resource contained in the Location header.

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/documents/11fe0bab-39bd-42ee-bb39-275afcc050d0
```

You’ll also get a webhook with a `customer_verification_document_uploaded` event to let you know the document was successfully uploaded.

### Document review process

Once created, the document will be reviewed by Dwolla. When our team has made a decision, which may take up to 1-2 business days to approve or reject, we’ll create either a `customer_verification_document_approved` or `customer_verification_document_failed` event.

If the document was sufficient, the Customer may be verified in this process. If not, we may need additional documentation. Note: Reference the [determining verification documents needed](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/customers/verified-personal/handle-verification-statuses.html#determining-verification-documents-needed) section for more information on determining if additional documents are needed after an approved or failed event is triggered.

If the document was found to be fraudulent or doesn’t match the identity of the Customer, the Customer will be suspended.

### Document failure

A document can fail if, for example, the Customer uploaded the wrong type of document or the `.jpg` or `.png` file supplied was not readable (i.e. blurry, not well lit, not in color, or cuts off a portion of the identifying image). If you receive a `customer_verification_document_failed` webhook, you’ll need to upload another document. To retrieve the failure reason for the document upload, you’ll retrieve the document by its ID. Contained in the response will be a `failureReason` field which corresponds to one or more of the following values. In case of a failure due to multiple reasons, an additional `allFailureReasons` array of `reason`s and `description`s is also returned :

| Failure reason                      | Description                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <code>ScanNotReadable</code>        | Image blurry, too dark, or obscured by glare                           |
| <code>ScanNotUploaded</code>        | Scan not uploaded                                                      |
| <code>ScanIdExpired</code>          | ID is expired                                                          |
| <code>ScanIdTypeNotSupported</code> | ID may be a military ID, firearm license, or other unsupported ID type |
| <code>ScanNameMismatch</code>       | Name mismatch                                                          |
| <code>ScanDobMismatch</code>        | Date of birth mismatch                                                 |
| <code>ScanFailedOther</code>        | ID may be fraudulent or a generic example ID image                     |
