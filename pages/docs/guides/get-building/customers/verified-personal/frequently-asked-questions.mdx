##### Q: My Customer has a `verified` status, but is unable to send funds. Why is this?

- Your Customer has likely not completed the bank verification process. You can check to see the status of the funding source [via the API](https://docs.dwolla.com/#list-funding-sources-for-a-customer) or by going into the [Dwolla dashboard](https://www.dwolla.com/platform/dashboard/).

##### Q: Can I change a `Verified` Customer type to an `Unverified` Customer type?

- No. Downgrade functionality is not supported for Dwolla Verified Customers.

##### Q: My Customer has a `document` status. Can I submit more than one document via the API?

- Yes, although this is not necessary, nor recommended. Dwolla manually reviews all documents, so sending more documents than necessary may slow down the verification process for your Customers.

##### Q: My end user is not a US resident, can they still create a Personal Verified Customer via the API to access my application?

- No. At this time, Dwolla only supports end users that are US residents when creating Personal Verified Customers.

##### Q: My Customer needs to send more funds than is allowed in my Dwolla services agreement. What is the best way to go about this?

- Your Customer is able to send multiple separate transfers as long as each transfer amount is less than the transfer limit defined in your services agreement.

      >Example Scenario: The transaction limit for my Customer is $10,000 and they need to send $15,000.
      In this case, you can prompt your Customer to send two transfers. One for $10,000 and another for $5,000.
