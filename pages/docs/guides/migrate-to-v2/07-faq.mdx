# FAQ

1.  **Are OAuth user access tokens I used in v1 the same as the account access tokens needed for API the Access API?**
    - Yes! OAuth and access tokens are shared across both APIs therefore nothing will change with regards to any current user account tokens you may have stored. Make sure these access tokens contain the proper scopes to call Access API resources.
2.  **If I am currently storing a unique identifier (transaction id, funding source id, dwolla id) used in v1—can I retrieve an equivalent identifier that is used for the Access API?**
    - There is currently not a way to obtain unique identifiers used in the Access API from ids you may have stored from API v1 (with the exception of [account id](https://docs.dwolla.com/#get-basic-account-info)). We are currently investigating a solution to return links to related resources in the Access API, and we’ll communicate this to the developer community if/when one is available.
3.  **How do I retrieve an 812-xxx-xxx number that is used to uniquely identify an account in v1?**
    - In the Access API, Dwolla Id’s are replaced with account ids that have the following format: ca32853c-48fa-40be-ae75-77b37504581b. A link to the account id will be returned if you call to retrieve [account](https://docs.dwolla.com/#get-full-account-info) details in API v1.
4.  **How can I differentiate a full Dwolla account from a Direct Dwolla account in the Access API?**
    - The Access API does not explicitly return the type of account when retrieving [account details](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#retrieve-account-details). As a workaround, full Dwolla accounts will have a balance attached whereas Dwolla Direct accounts do not. You can retrieve the [list of funding sources](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#list-funding-sources-for-an-account) for an Account to determine if a balance funding source is available for the user account.
5.  **Is a Dwolla PIN needed in order to transfer money in API the Access API?**
    - No—a Dwolla PIN is not required in the Access API in order to send money. It’s important to keep in mind that every transaction within your application must be authorized and initiated by the user.
