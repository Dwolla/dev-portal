# V1 to Access API endpoint changes

The table below provides a mapping of endpoints in v1 to their equivalent in the Access API. Links to the Access API reference docs are provided alongside each method. Not all Access API endpoints are listed, therefore you’ll want to reference the API docs for new functionality such as [Customers](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#customers) and [Webhook-Subscriptions](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#webhook-subscriptions).
