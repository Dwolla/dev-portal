# Other notable changes

#### Webhooks - v1 vs. the Access API

- **Webhook payload differences** - One of the biggest differences in webhooks sent in v1 vs. the Access API is the type of data included in the webhook payload.
  - In v1, the JSON payload includes detailed information on the resource that caused the webhook to be sent. For example, a [TransactionStatus](https://docs.dwolla.com/#transactionstatus) webhook would include the entire Transaction Resource with information such as Transaction Id, SourceName, DestinationName, Type, Fees, etc.
  - In the Access API, each webhook sent by Dwolla contains an [Event](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#events) object with an event topic (e.g. transfer_created) and \_links to: the associated resource, account associated with the event, and the customer associated with the event (if applicable). Your application will then follow a link to the resource contained in the event to lookup additional information.
- **Subscribing a webhook URL**
  - In v1, the manner in which you registered a URL for receiving webhook notifications was done entirely through the dwolla.com.
  - In the Access API, you’ll create a webhook-subscription which is done [via the API](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#create-a-webhook-subscription) using an [application access token](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#application-access-token).
- **Failed webhook attempts and retries**
  - In v1, webhook notifications were only sent once—regardless of whether or not your server responded to the request from Dwolla.
  - In the Access API, if your server doesn’t acknowledge the webhook request from Dwolla with a 2xx level status code, then the request will be retried on an exponential backoff schedule. Reference the API docs for more information on [acknowledgement and retries](https://docsv2.dwolla.com/#webhook-subscriptions).
- **Authenticating webhooks** - To ensure that the requests are coming from a valid source, Dwolla signs webhook requests so that you can verify that any requests you receive are generated by Dwolla and not someone pretending to be Dwolla.
  - Webhook requests in v1 included a X-Dwolla-Signature header, which is an SHA-1 HMAC hash of the request body salted using the consumer application secret.
  - In the Access API, a X-Request-Signature-Sha-256 header is included which is a SHA256 HMAC hash of the request body with the key being your webhook secret. Reference our [webhooks guide](https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/webhooks/03-validating-webhooks.html) for more information on validating webhook requests.

#### Transactions - How transactions work

- **Transaction Ids**
  - In v1, when a payment is sent, two or more transactions are created. At least one is created to credit the recipient’s account, and another one to debit the sender’s account. As a simple example, let’s say Bob sends $5 to Alice from his account balance. From this action, two Transactions are created: Transaction 512010: credits Alice’s account with $5. Transaction 512011: deducts \$5 from Bob’s account. It’s important to keep in mind that when Bob looks at this payment, he will see the credit transaction’s ID: 512010. This is called the Sender’s Transaction ID. Similarly, when Alice looks up this payment, she will see a different transaction of ID 512011, which we call the Recipient’s Transaction ID.
  - In the Access API, we’ve reduced the number of unique Ids returned on a payment from two transaction Ids to a single transfer Id.
- **How transactions are displayed in dwolla.com and emails** - Since unique transaction Ids are different in the Access API they will **not** match Ids that are displayed in the legacy dashboard at https://www.dwolla.com or within Dwolla emails. A new dashboard will be released which displays Access API Ids that can be used to reconcile against transfers created in the API.

#### Facilitator Fees

- Fees must be specified via the API on a per request basis
- By default, fees are sent to the account of the application owner
- Only flat fees can be specified, not a percentage on the amount of the transfer
