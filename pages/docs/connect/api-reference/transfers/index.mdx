# Transfers

A transfer represents money being transferred from a `source` to a `destination`. Transfers can be created over the ACH network or over Wire. A Debit represents funds being debited from an <span><ContentTooltip preset="external-party">external party</ContentTooltip></span>'s funding source. A Credit represents funds being credited to an external party's funding source.

### Transfer Statuses

Once a transfer is successfully created, it can go through various status changes as it moves from Dwolla to your bank for processing. Reference the list below that includes every possible status and a brief description:

| Status    | Description                                                                                                                        |
