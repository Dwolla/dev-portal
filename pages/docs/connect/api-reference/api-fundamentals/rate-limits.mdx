# Rate Limits

Dwolla imposes a rate limit for any applications that make requests to our API. Currently, we have the following rate limit defined:

- Volume-based: If the rate limit is reached for an endpoint, subsequent requests will result in an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status code, which will persist for 5 minutes. At this time, these thresholds are defined as outside the range of what we consider normal API usage.

Dwolla recommends building a mechanism into your application to handle 429 Too Many Requests responses, which would retry the request following an exponential backoff schedule to reduce request volume, and utilizes [idempotency keys](https://developers.dwolla.com/docs/connect/api-reference/api-fundamentals/idempotency-key), where applicable. This ensures actions only perform once and prevents creation of duplicate records.

If you believe that your application will require a high rate of API calls, please contact support@dwolla.com for further assistance.
