# Handling Responses

When you make a request to the Dwolla API, your request is processed and a response is returned. This response, in JSON format, contains information about the success or failure of your request, along with any relevant data.

This section will guide you through the structure and components of Dwolla API responses, helping you interpret the information they provide.

By understanding how to read and interpret API responses, you can effectively troubleshoot issues, extract valuable data, and build robust integrations with the Dwolla platform.

### Status Codes

Status codes are numerical codes that indicate the outcome of an API request. They provide essential information about the success or failure of the request.

##### Common Status Codes:

- **200 OK:** The request was successful.
- **201 Created:** The request was successful, and a new resource was created.
- **400 Bad Request:** The request was malformed or cannot be understood.
- **401 Unauthorized:** The request requires authentication.
- **403 Forbidden:** The authenticated user/application is not authorized to perform the request.
- **404 Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** An unexpected error occurred on the server.
  Example:

```json
{
  "code": "BadRequest",
  "message": "The request body contains bad syntax or is incomplete."
}
```

This response indicates a top-level error code of BadRequest with a descriptive error message explaining the issue.

### Response Headers

Response headers provide supplementary details about the response. They can contain information about the content type, date, and other relevant data.

**HTTP headers are case-insensitive by definition**. This means that the Dwolla API, like most HTTP servers, might return headers in various capitalization formats. For instance, you could receive a Location header as `location` or `Location`. While HTTP/2 mandates lowercase header names, older HTTP/1.1 connections might still use mixed casing.

To ensure consistent handling, it's recommended to normalize header names to lowercase within your application. This involves converting all header names to lowercase before accessing their values. This approach provides a reliable way to reference headers without worrying about inconsistent capitalization.

For example, if you're expecting a `Location` header, you should check for `location` as well to ensure you capture all possible variations.

##### Common Headers

Here are some common headers you might encounter in Dwolla API responses:

- **Date:** The date and time at which the message was generated.
- **Content-Type:** Specifies the format of the response body (e.g., application/json).
- **Content-Length:** : Indicates the size of the response body in bytes.
- **Location:** : Indicates the URL of the newly created resource (used in 201 Created responses).

**Custom Headers:** The `X-Request-ID` and `CF-RAY` headers provide additional information that can be used for debugging purposes.
