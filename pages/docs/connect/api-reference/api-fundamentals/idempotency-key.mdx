# Idempotency Key

To prevent an operation from being performed more than once, Dwolla supports passing in an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique key as the value. Multiple `POST`s with the same idempotency key and request body won't result in multiple resources being created. It is recommended to use a random value for the idempotency key, like a UUID (i.e. - `Idempotency-Key: d2adcbab-4e4e-430b-9181-ac9346be723a`).

For example, if a request to [initiate a transfer](/docs/connect/api-reference/transfers/initiate) fails due to a network connection issue, you can reattempt the request with the same idempotency key to guarantee that only a single transfer is created.

If you reattempt a `POST` request with the same value for the `Idempotency-Key`, rather than creating new or potentially duplicate resources, you will receive a `201 Created`, with the original response of the created resource. If the Dwolla server is still processing the original `POST` request, you will receive a `409 Conflict` error response on the subsequent request. Multiple `POST`s with the same idempotency key including an **exact match** request body won’t result in multiple resources being created. Idempotency keys are intended to prevent conflicts over a short period of time, therefore keys which are paired with a request body expire after 24 hours.

Info CTA: To prevent resources from being created more than once, we highly recommend making all requests idempotent.
