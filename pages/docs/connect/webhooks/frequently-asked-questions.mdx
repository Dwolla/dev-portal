    <span>Q: What is an Event vs Webhook Subscription vs Webhook?</span>
  }
>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="/api-reference/events">Event</a> — An event is a unique resource
      that gets created whenever an action occurs in Dwolla that changes the
      state of an API resource like an external party being created or a funding
      source being verified.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/api-reference/webhook-subscriptions">Webhook Subscription</a> —
      A webhook subscription is a resource in the API that you can create in
      order to subscribe to Dwolla webhooks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/api-reference/webhooks">Webhook</a> — A webhook is an HTTP
      request that Dwolla sends to your subscribed URL to notify your app of an
      event. In order to get webhook notifications, you will need to have an
      active webhook subscription.

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: Is a webhook subscription required to integrate with the Dwolla API?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    While a webhook subscription is not required for you to integrate with the
    API, Dwolla requires all applications to have one in production for
    automated notifications of events to your application. Webhooks provide
    automatic near real-time status updates to your application versus polling
    the API which causes unnecessary load on your application and the API.

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: How to validate that a webhook is coming from Dwolla? Is there a list
      of IP addresses that I can limit webhook requests from?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    Dwolla includes a <code>X-Request-Signature-SHA-256</code> header on each
    webhook request which is a SHA-256 HMAC hash of the request body with the
    key being the webhook <code>secret</code> you passed in when you created the
    webhook subscription. As a best practice, we recommend validating webhooks
    by generating the same SHA-256 HMAC hash and comparing it to the signature
    sent with the payload.
    <br />
    <br />
    We do not recommend nor support relying on IP whitelisting as a method of validating
    webhooks. Dwolla's IPs are dynamically allocated with no defined range and are
    subject to change. Refer to the Processing/Validating section for a more detailed
    guide.

<Collapsible
  triggerText={<span>Q: Can I subscribe to certain event topics?</span>}
>
  <p>
    Dwolla sends webhooks for all events that occur in your platform and there
    isn’t a way to filter what events you subscribe to.
  </p>

<Collapsible
  triggerText={<span>Q: My webhook subscription was paused. Why?</span>}

  <p>
    Dwolla automatically{" "}
    <a href="/api-reference/connect/webhook-subscriptions#automatic-pause-of-a-webhook-subscription">
      pauses a webhook subscription
    </a>{" "}
    after 400 consecutive failed delivery attempts and sends an email to notify
    the Admin of the Dwolla account. While it's paused, Dwolla isn’t able to
    send webhooks for new events to your URL. To resume webhooks, you need to{" "}
    <a href="/api-reference/connect/webhook-subscriptions#acknowledgement-and-retries">
      address the issue that’s causing failures
    </a>
    , <a href="/api-reference/connect/webhook-subscriptions/update#update-a-webhook-subscription">
      unpause the subscription
    </a> and <a href="/api-reference/connect/webhooks/retry#retry-a-webhook">
      retry missed webhooks
    </a>.
  </p>

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: Will webhooks be automatically retried if my subscription was
      previously paused or unavailable?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    No. If your webhook subscription was previously paused or unavailable,
    Dwolla will not attempt to re-deliver webhooks. In this case, you can{" "}
    <a href="/api-reference/connect/webhook-subscriptions/list-webhooks">
      list all webhooks by subscription
    </a>
    , filtering all that have zero attempts (in other words, the `attempts` array
    is empty), and <a href="/api-reference/connect/webhooks/retry">
      retrying each webhook individually
    </a>.
  </p>
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: How do I know if a webhook request failed and needs to be retried?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    When{" "}
    <a href="/api-reference/connect/webhook-subscriptions/list-webhooks">
      listing all webhooks by webhook subscription
    </a>
    , an embedded <code>attempts</code> array will include a <code>
      response
    </code> object that includes a <code>statusCode</code> property indicating the
    HTTP status code that Dwolla received when the webhook attempt was made. If the
    status code that Dwolla received was >=300, then the attempt was considered to
    have failed.
  </p>
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible
  triggerText={<span>Q: Can I create more than one webhook subscription?</span>}
>
  <p>
    Yes. You can create up to 5 webhook subscriptions in Production and 10 in
    Sandbox. While only one subscription is needed to be notified of all events,
    you can have multiple in case one or more of your URLs becomes unreachable.
