# Events

When the state of a resource changes, Dwolla creates a new event resource to record the change. When an Event is created, a <span><ContentTooltip preset="webhook" href="https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/webhooks">Webhook</ContentTooltip></span> will be created to deliver the Event to any URLs specified by your active [Webhook Subscriptions](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/webhook-subscriptions). To view example payloads for Customer related events, refer to the [Webhooks Events](https://developers.dwolla.com/concepts/webhook-events) resource within the Developer Docs.

[View our developer resource article](https://developers.dwolla.com/concepts/transfer-failures) to learn more. <br /> **Timing**: Occurs when Dwolla systematically marks a funding source unverified upon receiving certain ACH return codes when a transfer fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| customer_funding_source_negative   | **Description**: A Customer's `balance` has gone negative. You are responsible for ensuring a zero or positive Dwolla balance for Customer accounts created by your application. If a Customer balance funding source has gone negative, you are responsible for making the Dwolla Customer account whole.

If no action is taken, Dwolla will debit your attached billing source. <br /> **Timing**: Occurs upon a POST request to the [Initiate a transfer](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/transfers/initiate) endpoint that causes a funding source balance to go negative. |
