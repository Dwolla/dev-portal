# Exchanges

The Secure Exchange solution is a tokenized approach to creating an interconnected payment experience among third-party data providers, payment technologies and financial institutions.
The Exchanges API generates provider tokens, providing a secure way to receive data from third parties.
Today, Dwolla clients and reseller partners can utilize this API to perform functions such as creating funding-sources within the Dwolla ecosystem.
As more functionality is released, the functions this endpoint can perform will continue to expand.
