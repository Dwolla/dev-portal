# Retrieve bank balance

This section covers how to retrieve the current and available amount for a bank account added using Dwolla's [Open Banking solution](https://developers.dwolla.com/docs/balance/open-banking). This feature is designed to help businesses make more informed decisions before initiating ACH transactions, reducing the risk of failed payments due to insufficient funds.

#### Available and Closing Balance

There are two different amounts returned in the API response when retrieving a balance which correspond to an `available` and `closing` balance. Both balances provide important insights for businesses, with the `available` balance being the most relevant for determining whether there are sufficient funds to initiate an ACH transaction.

##### Available balance

Available balance is the amount of funds the customer is able to withdraw from the account, not including any credit facility that may be available. This balance includes pending inflows or outflows on the account and is the closest to a real-time balance. It is continuously updated to reflect all the charges/transactions/deposits as they occur. **Note:** The available balance won't always be returned.

##### Closing balance

The closing (or booked) balance represents the current balance of the account without factoring in any pending debits or credits. It reflects the settled balance as of the end of the previous business day, providing a snapshot of the funds that have been fully processed.

#### Last Updated

When calling the balance endpoint on a funding source, either initially or during a refresh, the response will include a `lastUpdated` parameter with a UTC timestamp. This timestamp indicates the most recent time Dwolla retrieved the balance from the open banking provider. The balance is cached by default and automatically refreshed in the background when the balance status changes, ensuring up-to-date information is available without requiring frequent manual checks.
