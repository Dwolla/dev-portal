# Open Banking

This section dives into the process of leveraging Dwolla's Exchange Sessions API for Instant Account Verification (IAV) within your application. Dwolla's Exchange Sessions API enables you to leverage open banking providers to perform bank account verification in real-time, streamlining your onboarding process and improving user experience. An Exchange Session represents a generated IAV session that is established between Dwolla and integrated open banking service providers for the purposes of user bank account verification.
