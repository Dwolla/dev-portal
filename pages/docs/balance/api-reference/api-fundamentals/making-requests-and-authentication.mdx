# Making Requests

To interact with the Dwolla API, all requests must include the `Accept` header:

- `Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json`

For POST requests, specify either of the following `Content-Type`:

- `Content-Type: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

All request and response bodies are JSON encoded.

Requests must be made over HTTPS. Any non-secure requests will be redirected (HTTP 302) to the HTTPS equivalent URI.

```bash
POST https://api.dwolla.com/customers
Content-Type: application/json

Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json
Authorization: Bearer myOAuthAccessToken123
{
"foo": "bar"
}

... or ...

GET https://api.dwolla.com/accounts/a84222d5-31d2-4290-9a96-089813ef96b3/transfers
```

## Authentication

All requests require either an OAuth access token or a `client_id` and `client_secret` in order to authenticate with the API. OAuth access tokens are passed via the Authorization HTTP header:

`Authorization: Bearer {access_token_here}`

## API Host

`Production: https://api.dwolla.com`
`Sandbox: https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com`
