# Step 1: Creating your Customer

## Choose the Customer Type for Your Funds Flow

Before your end user can send or receive funds to their connected bank account, they must be created as a Customer via the Dwolla API. With this funds flow, however, the only eligible Customer types are:

- Verified Personal Customers
- Verified Business Customers

To learn more on the differences between personal and business verified Customers and the capabilities of each, [check out our developer resource article.](/concepts/customer-types)

<AlertBar variation="info">
  Verified Customers must go through the identity verification process and have
  a <code>verified</code> status in order to be eligible to transact. In order
  to verify the identity of the individual or business creating a Dwolla
  Customer account, you will need to pass information including, but not limited
  to, social security number (ssn), address, date of birth, and/or Employer
  Identification Number (EIN).

## Step 1A. Create the Customer

While both the Personal and Business verified Customer types are valid in this funds flow, we will be creating a Personal verified Customer in this guide.

```

When the Customer is successfully created on your application, you will receive a `201` HTTP response with an empty response body. You can reference the Location header to retrieve a link that represents the created Customer resource. We recommend storing the full URL for future use, as it will be needed for actions such as attaching a bank or correlating <span><ContentTooltip preset="webhook">webhooks</ContentTooltip></span> that are triggered for the user in the Dwolla system.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  Providing the IP address of the end user accessing your application as the
  <code> ipAddress</code> parameter. This enhances fraud detection and tracking.
</AlertBar>

## Step 1B: Handle Webhooks

If you have an active webhook subscription, you will receive the `customer_created` and `customer_verified` webhook immediately after the resource has been created.

## Additional expected behavior

### Customer Statuses

Not all Customers will have a `verified` status upon initial Customer creation. In production, you may run into an instance where more information is needed from your end user in order for Dwolla to fully verify their identity. Other statuses your Customer may be placed in include, `retry`, `document`, `deactivated`, or `suspended`. For more information on these statuses, refer to our developer resource article.

### Balance Funding Source

On successful Customer verification, Dwolla will also create a [Balance Funding Source](/concepts/balance-funding-source) for this Customer.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  There are two types of Funding Sources available within the Dwolla Platform
  which include a bank or a balance. A bank account is commonly used as the
  source or destination for ACH transfers. A <code> balance</code> is a Funding
  Source that can be utilized like a “wallet” for holding a stored value of
  funds. The Dwolla balance is made available for Customers that have fully{" "}
  <code> verified</code> their identity within Dwolla.
