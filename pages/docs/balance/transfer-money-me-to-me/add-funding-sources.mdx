# Step 2: Adding Funding Sources

Within Dwolla, the sending party must always [verify their bank account](/guides/plaid) in order to be eligible to create a transfer.

## Bank Addition and Verification Methods

There are multiple ways of adding a bank to a Customer with the Dwolla API. A simplified table below outlines the similarities and differences of each method.

| Bank Addition Method                                                        | Will the bank be verified?    | Required Information            |

## Step 2A: Add a Bank to a Verified Personal Customer

Next, you will create and attach a verified funding source to your Customer, which will be done using Plaid Link, a third-party bank verification provider. This method will give your Customers the ability to add and verify their bank account in a matter of seconds by authenticating using their online banking credentials.

Once your Customer reaches the page in your application to add a bank account, you will first use Plaid Link to authenticate the user's bank account, exchange the `public_token` for a `processor_token`, and then send the `processor_token` to Dwolla to create the funding source.

To integrate Dwolla with Plaid, we recommend checking out our [Add a Bank via Dwolla + Plaid Integration](/guides/plaid) guide. Additionally, if you would like to see a working example that verifies a bank via Plaid Link (using Next.js/React) and attaches it as a verified funding source to a Dwolla Customer, please check out our [dwolla-plaid-funding-source](https://github.com/Dwolla/integration-examples/blob/main/dwolla-plaid-funding-source) integration example on our GitHub profile.

## Step 2B: Handle Webhooks

If you have an active webhook subscription, you should receive both the `customer_funding_source_added` and `customer_funding_source_verified` <span><ContentTooltip preset="webhook">webhooks</ContentTooltip></span> immediately following the request to Dwolla to add a funding source using a Plaid `processorToken`.

## Step 2C: Add a Savings Account

Once you have integrated Dwolla with Plaid, and you have attached a customer's `checking` account, you will want to repeat the same steps outlined above to add the customer's `savings` account as a funding source as well.
