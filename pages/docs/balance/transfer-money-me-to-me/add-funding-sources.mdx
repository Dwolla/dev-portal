# Step 2: Adding Funding Sources

Within Dwolla, the sending party must always verify their bank account in order to be eligible to create a transfer.

## Bank Addition and Verification Methods

There are multiple ways of adding a bank to a Customer with the Dwolla API. A simplified table below outlines the similarities and differences of each method.

## Step 2A: Add a Bank to a Verified Personal Customer

In this step, we will create and attach a verified funding source to your Customer using Dwolla's Open Banking solution with Visa, a leading Open Banking service provider that Dwolla partners with. This method will give your Customers the ability to add and verify their bank account in a matter of seconds by authenticating using their online banking credentials.

Once your Customer reaches the page in your application to add a bank account, you will use Open Banking with Visa to authenticate the user's bank account. This involves initiating an <span><ContentTooltip preset="exchange-session">Exchange Session</ContentTooltip></span> with Dwolla, guiding the user through the verification process with their bank, and then using the <span><ContentTooltip preset="exchange">Exchange</ContentTooltip></span> details to create a funding source in Dwolla.

To integrate Open Banking with Visa, we recommend checking out our [integration guide](https://developers.dwolla.com/docs/balance/open-banking/visa). Additionally, if you would like to see a working example that verifies a bank using Open Banking with Visa and attaches it as a verified funding source to a Dwolla Customer, please check out our [open-banking/visa](https://github.com/Dwolla/integration-examples/tree/main/packages/open-banking/visa) integration example on our GitHub profile.

## Step 2B: Handle Webhooks

If you have an active webhook subscription, you should receive both the `customer_funding_source_added` and `customer_funding_source_verified` <span><ContentTooltip preset="webhook">webhooks</ContentTooltip></span> immediately following the request to Dwolla to add a funding source using Open Banking.

## Step 2C: Add a Savings Account

Once you have implemented Dwolla's Open Banking solution with Visa, and you have attached a customer's `checking` account, you will want to repeat the same steps outlined above to add the customer's `savings` account as a funding source as well.
