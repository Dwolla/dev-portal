# Add a Bank Funding Source with Plaid

Dwolla partners with Plaid to provide customers with bank account verification through a tokenized solution. Bank accounts are linked with purpose-built tokens between the Dwolla and Plaid platforms.

While **bank account verification is required** before initiating an ACH transaction from a [funding source](/api-reference/funding-sources), Dwolla clients are able to choose between Dwolla's [micro-deposit solution](/api-reference/funding-sources/initiate-micro-deposits) or a third-party data aggregator, such as Mastercard, MX, or, as we will discuss in further detail in this guide, Plaid.

For more information on Dwolla's tokenized solutions with other third-party data aggregators, check out our [Secure Exchange solution](/docs/balance/secure-exchange)!

## Prerequisites

Let's first go over a few items you need to check off before you begin your integration.

- Set up a [Dwolla Production](https://accounts.dwolla.com) account, or a [Dwolla Sandbox](https://accounts-sandbox.dwolla.com) account if you're still developing or testing your application.
- Set up a [Plaid Production](https://dashboard.plaid.com) account, or a Plaid Sandbox account if you're still developing or testing your application.
- Enable Dwolla's Plaid integration in your Plaid [account settings](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/integrations). If you need assistance with this step, reach out to your Account Manager with Plaid.
- Customize Plaid Link's account selection to only be "[enabled for one account](https://dashboard.plaid.com/link/account-select)."

Adding a bank is a one-time process that verifies the account ownership of the underlying bank account being added by an end user. At the end of this guide, you'll obtain a Funding Source URL, which is a unique identifier that represents a bank account being used for ACH debits and/or credits.

## Integrate with Plaid

Once you have your Dwolla and Plaid accounts set up, you can begin the integration process. For the following steps, we will make use of two Plaid libraries: Plaid Link (more specifically, [react-plaid-link](https://github.com/plaid/react-plaid-link)), Plaid Link's React bindings, and [plaid-node](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-node), Plaid's server-side Node SDK.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  In this guide we'll use Plaid Link's React bindings. However, <a
  href="https://plaid.com/docs/link/">Plaid offers
  additional libraries</a> if you are developing for another environment, such as Android or iOS.

Additionally, since most of our interaction with Plaid's API will occur server-side, we'll make use of <a
  href="https://github.com/plaid/plaid-node">Plaid's Node bindings</a>. Similar to Plaid Link's React bindings, <a
  href="https://plaid.com/docs/quickstart/">Plaid offers additional libraries</a> for other server-side programming
languages.

### Create a Link Token

In order to instantiate a Plaid Link instance—in our case, by using `usePlaidLink`—you first need to have your server generate a Link token. To learn more about what properties are available, check out Plaid's [Create Link Token](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate) documentation.

Though you are welcome to use additional Plaid products and customize the `LinkTokenCreateRequest` object to your liking, **a couple properties are required in order to be compatible with Dwolla**:

- `country_codes` must include "US" (or an enumerative equivalent), as Dwolla is currently only able to transact with U.S.-based bank accounts.
- `products` must include "auth" (or an enumerative equivalent), as Dwolla will fetch the associated account and routing number using Plaid Auth.

```typescript
import type { LinkTokenCreateRequest, LinkTokenCreateResponse } from "plaid";
import { CountryCode, Products } from "plaid";
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

const createLinkToken = async (): Promise<LinkTokenCreateResponse> => {
  const request: LinkTokenCreateRequest = {
    client_name: "Dwolla-Plaid Integration Example",
    country_codes: [CountryCode.Us],
    language: "en",
    products: [Products.Auth],
    user: { client_user_id: uuidv4() },
    redirect_uri: "http://localhost:3000",
  };
  return (await plaidClient.linkTokenCreate(request)).data;
};
```

### Instantiate Plaid Link

Once your client environment has made the necessary requests to your server to fetch the Link token, you can now give that token to `usePlaidLink` with an additional `onSuccess` handler.

The `onSuccess` handler will be responsible for proxying client requests to your server to, at a minimum,

1. Exchange the public token for an access token.
2. Exchange the access token and account ID for a processor token.
3. Create a funding source using the processor token.

```typescript
import type { PlaidLinkOnSuccess } from "react-plaid-link";
import { usePlaidLink } from "react-plaid-link";

const handlePlaidLinkSuccess: PlaidLinkOnSuccess = async (
  publicToken,
  metadata
) => {
  // TODO: Exchange public token for an access token
  // TODO: Exchange access token & accountID for a processor token
  // TODO: Create a funding source using the processor token
};

const { open, ready } = usePlaidLink({
  onSuccess: handlePlaidLinkSuccess,
  token: linkToken, // linkToken is the Link token that your server sent
});
```

### Exchange Public Token for Access Token

Now that you have your public token, you will need to exchange it for an access token back in your server environment. An access token is an intermediate step between a public token and a processor token, and can be generated in a one-line JavaScript function using Plaid's Node SDK.

```typescript
// 1. Exchange public token for an access token
export const exchangeForAccessToken = async (
  publicToken: string
): Promise<string> =>
  (await plaidClient.itemPublicTokenExchange({ public_token: publicToken }))
    .data.access_token;
```

### Exchange Access Token and Account ID for Processor Token

Continuing in your server environment, once you have an access token and an account ID (account ID is returned by Plaid Link in your client environment), you can now create a processor token!

Similar to how you created a Link token, when creating a processor token, you must specify Dwolla ("dwolla") as the processor. If you are using Plaid's SDK, you can use an enumerative equivalent, such as `ProcessorTokenCreateRequestProcessorEnum.Dwolla`.

```typescript
import { ProcessorTokenCreateRequestProcessorEnum } from "plaid";

export const exchangeForProcessorToken = async (
  accessToken: string,
  accountId: string
): Promise<string> =>
  (
    await plaidClient.processorTokenCreate({
      access_token: accessToken,
      account_id: accountId,
      processor: ProcessorTokenCreateRequestProcessorEnum.Dwolla,
    })
  ).data.processor_token;
```

Once your application has generated the processor token, you are now ready to integrate with Dwolla!

## Integrate with Dwolla

Before creating a funding source, your application will need to create a Customer. If you have not created a customer yet, check out our [Create a Customer](/api-reference/customers/create) API reference, or our [Create a Business Verified Customer](/docs/balance/business-verified-customer) or [Create a Personal Verified Customer](/docs/balance/personal-verified-customer) guides.

Once you have a customer set up, we will use Dwolla's [server-side Node SDK](https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-node) to create the funding source.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  While we are using Dwolla's Node SDK for the sake of demonstration in this
  guide,{" "}
  <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/sdks-tools">
    Dwolla also offers additional libraries
  </a>{" "}
  for other server-side programming languages.
</AlertBar>

### Create a Funding Source

To create a verified funding source for a customer, you will supply two required properties: `name` and `plaidToken`. In the API request, `name` defines an arbitrary name that you or your user will assign to the funding source, and `plaidToken` defines the Plaid processor token that was generated in the previous step.

In the following function, once a response is received, it will extract the `Location` header value, which is the fully-qualified URL specifying the resource location of your funding source.

```typescript
interface CreateFundingSourceOptions {
  customerId: string;
  fundingSourceName: string;
  plaidToken: string;
}

const createFundingSource = async (
  options: CreateFundingSourceOptions
): Promise<string> =>
  (
    await dwollaClient.post(`customers/${options.customerId}/funding-sources`, {
      name: options.fundingSourceName,
      plaidToken: options.plaidToken,
    })
  ).headers.get("Location");
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: How does Dwolla integrate with Plaid when a{" "}
      <code>processor_token</code> is received?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    When creating a funding source,{" "}
    <a href="#create-a-funding-source">
      a Plaid <code>processor_token</code> value is passed in using the{" "}
      <code>plaidToken</code> key.
    </a>{" "}
    With this information, Dwolla executes a call to Plaid's API to securely
    retrieve the account and routing number and creates a funding source on your
    behalf. Upon success, Dwolla returns a URL that represents the new funding
    source via the <code>Location</code> response header.

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: Does Plaid work if the user has two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled
      on their bank account?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    Yes, if the end user has 2FA enabled with their bank, Plaid will attempt to
    mimic their bank's login flow, meaning that the user should receive a 2FA
    code, and is subsequently prompted to enter it in on the next screen.
  </p>
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: If Plaid's <code>access_token</code> and <code>processor_token</code>{" "}
      changes or expires, what happens to the Dwolla funding source?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    If the <code>processor_token</code> has already been used to create a
    funding source, then the token changing or expiring will not affect it;
    Dwolla only uses the <code>processor_token</code> to fetch the account and
    routing number from Plaid and then immediately discards it.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    However, if you have not yet used the <code>processor_token</code> to create
    a funding source, then you will need to follow Plaid's process for creating
    a new token before sending it over to Dwolla.
  </p>
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: Can I use Plaid's micro-deposit solution instead of Dwolla's?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    Yes, it is possible to use Plaid Link to both automatically verify bank
    accounts and manually verify via micro-deposits if the bank is not supported
    or an error occurs during automatic verification.
  </p>
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: Will Dwolla's funding source status change if Plaid's account status
      changes (e.g., micro-deposit verification)?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    No. Since Dwolla only uses Plaid to securely retrieve the account and
    routing number, any changes to the underlying Plaid account will not affect
    the funding source(s) that have already been created in Dwolla.
  </p>
</Collapsible>

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: Why did a transfer fail with an ACH return (e.g. R04 - Invalid Account
      Number) if the associated bank was successfully added and verified through
      Plaid?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    This issue can occur when the user's bank utilizes Tokenized Account Numbers
    (TANs) for bank verification, and Plaid provides Dwolla with the TAN instead
    of the actual Account Number. Dwolla processes the ACH payment using the
    TAN. If the user has disabled TAN transactions on their bank's website, the
    ACH payment made by Dwolla will fail with an ACH return (e.g., R04 - Invalid
    Account Number).
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    To resolve this issue, advise the user to contact their bank or visit their
    bank's website and enable TANs for future transfers. In some cases, it might
    be necessary to re-add the Plaid verified bank using a new processor token.
