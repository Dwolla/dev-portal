# Step 4: Attach a verified funding source

Next, you will create and attach a verified funding source to Joe Buyer, which will be done using Dwolla's Open Banking solution with Visa, a leading Open Banking service provider that Dwolla partners with. This method will give Joe Buyer the ability to add and verify their bank account in a matter of seconds by authenticating using their online banking credentials.

Once Joe Buyer reaches the page in your application to add a bank account, you will use Open Banking with Visa to authenticate their bank account. This involves initiating an <span><ContentTooltip preset="exchange-session">Exchange Session</ContentTooltip></span> with Dwolla, guiding the user through the verification process with their bank, and then using the <span><ContentTooltip preset="exchange">Exchange</ContentTooltip></span> details to create a funding source in Dwolla.
