# Testing Customers

### Manage Customers in the Dashboard

The [Sandbox Dashboard](https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com) allows you to manage Customers, as well as transfers associated with the Customers that belong to your <span><ContentTooltip preset="sandbox">Sandbox</ContentTooltip></span> account. Once your application has [created its Customers](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/customers/create), you can access the [Sandbox Dashboard](https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com) to validate that the request was recorded properly in our test environment.

### Simulate identity verification statuses

There are various reasons a [Verified Customer](/concepts/customer-types#verified-customer) may have a status other than `verified` after the initial Customer creation. You will want your app to be prepared to handle these alternative statuses.

In production, Dwolla will place the Verified Customer in either the `retry`, `kba`, `document`, `verified`, or `suspended` state of verification after an initial identity verification check.

**For personal Verified Customers**: Reference the guide on [customer verification](https://developers.dwolla.com/docs/balance/personal-verified-customer) for more information on handling identity verification for Verified Customers. To simulate the various statuses in the Sandbox, supply either `verified`, `retry`, `kba`, `document`, or `suspended` in the **firstName** parameter in order to [create a new Verified Customer](https://developers.dwolla.com/docs/balance/api-reference/customers/create#verified-personal-customer---request-parameters) with that status.

**For business Verified Customers**: Reference the guide on [customer verification](https://developers.dwolla.com/docs/balance/business-verified-customer) that goes over information on properly verifying a business's Controller, the business, and associated Beneficial Owners.

Here's how to simulate the different statuses and verification links for business Verified Customers in Sandbox:

`retry` status:

- For the business - Supply `retry` in the **businessName** parameter. This action will return a `retry-verification` link in the Customer resource.

- For both the Controller and business - Supply `retry` in the **controller firstName** parameter. This action will return both a `retry-verification` link and a `retry-with-full-ssn` link in the Customer resource.

`document` status:

- For the controller - Supply `document` in the **controller firstName** parameter. This action will return a `verify-with-document` linkin the Customer resource.

- For the business - Supply `document` in the **businessName** parameter. This action will return a `verify-business-with-document` link in the Customer resource.

- For both the Controller and the business - Submit `document` in both the **controller firstName** and the **businessName** parameters. This action will return a `verify-controller-and-business-with-document` link in the Customer resource.

`suspended`:

- Supply `suspended` in the **controller firstName** parameter to create a new Verified Customer with that status.

**For beneficial owners**:
To simulate different verification statuses for Beneficial Owners, submit either `incomplete` or `document` in the **beneficial owner firstName** parameter.

### Simulate KBA verified and failed events

If a Personal Verified Customer isn't systematically identity-verified after their second attempt to retry their information, the Customer may be placed in a `kba` status and will be required to successfully answer at least three out of four knowledge based authentication (KBA) questions in order to pass verification.

<InlineCTA
  icon={guidesIcon}
  text="More information on KBA status for Personal Verified Customers and the related endpoints."
  href="/guides/personal-verified-customer/handle-verification-statuses#handling-status-kba"
/>

To simulate the `customer_kba_verification_passed` event as the result of KBA success in Sandbox, answer all four questions with either "None of the above" or "I have never been associated with this vehicle". As a result, the Customer will be placed in a verified status and the `customer_verified` event is triggered.

To simulate the `customer_kba_verification_failed` event as the result of KBA failure in Sandbox, answer the questions with any answer choices other than "None of the above" or "I have never been associated with this vehicle". As a result, the Customer will be placed in a document status and the `customer_verification_document_needed` event is triggered.

### Simulate document upload approved and failed events

If a Verified Customer isn't systematically identity-verified, the Customer may be placed in a `document` status and will require an identifying document to be uploaded and reviewed. Reference either the [personal customer verification](/guides/personal-verified-customer/handle-verification-statuses#document-types) or [business customer verification](/guides/business-verified-customer/handle-verification-statuses#document-types) guide for acceptable forms of identifying documents for `Verified Customers`.

Since the document review process requires interaction from Dwolla, sample test documents can be uploaded in the Sandbox environment to simulate the `customer_verification_document_approved` and `customer_verification_document_failed` events.

### Simulate verification directives

You can test how your application handles specific embedded error codes (Verification Directives) in the Sandbox environment using the `/sandbox-simulations` endpoint. This allows you to simulate the Dwolla API returning a particular verification directive for a business Verified Customer.

<InlineCTA
  icon={guidesIcon}
  text="Learn more about the structure and meaning of these directives in the Understanding Verification Directives section."
  href="/docs/balance/business-verified-customer/handle-verification-statuses#understanding-verification-directives"
/>

The following error codes can be triggered:

- **ControllerNonResidential**
- **POBoxNotAllowed**
- **AddressNotAssociatedWithBusiness**
- **EINDocumentRequired**

To simulate one of these error codes:

1. Create a business Verified Customer in the Sandbox.
2. Make a POST request to the `/sandbox-simulations` endpoint with a request body like the following:

```json
POST https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/sandbox-simulations
Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json
Content-Type: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json
Authorization: Bearer {Your access token}

{
    "type": "customer-verification",
    "_links": {
        "customer": {
            "href": "https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/customers/{customer-id}"
        }
    },
    "errorCode": "AddressNotAssociatedWithBusiness"
}
```

Replace `{customer-id}` with the ID of your Sandbox customer, and set `errorCode` to one of the supported values (e.g., `ControllerNonResidential`, `POBoxNotAllowed`, `AddressNotAssociatedWithBusiness`, or `EINDocumentRequired`).

After making this request, retrieve the Customer resource using the API. The specified error code will appear in the `_embedded.errors` array of the response, allowing you to test your application's handling of these verification directives.
