# Testing Transfers

The Sandbox environment does not replicate any bank transfer processes, so a pending transfer will not clear or fail automatically after a few business days as it would in production. The transfer will simply remain in the pending state indefinitely.

### Simulate bank transfer processing

There are two options available for processing or failing bank transfers in the Sandbox environment.

- **Option 1:** your application will call the "sandbox-simulations" endpoint (referenced below) which will process or fail the last 500 bank transfers that occurred on the authorized application or Sandbox account.
- **Option 2:** you'll use the "Process bank transfers button" in the Sandbox Dashboard, which will process or fail the last 500 bank transfers that occurred on your Sandbox account or any API `Customers` you manage.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  If a bank-to-bank transaction is initiated between two users, you'll want to
  simulate bank transfer processing twice in order to process both sides of the
  transaction (debit and credit). Processing for bank transfers will also
  include initiated micro-deposits. If your application is{" "}
  <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/webhook-subscriptions">
    subscribed to webhooks
  </a>
  , notifications will be sent, including all transfer or micro-deposit related events,
  letting your application know that transfers have processed or failed.

```bash
POST https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/sandbox-simulations
Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json
Content-Type: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json
Authorization: Bearer {Your access token}

    }
  },
  "total": 8
}
```

### Process bank transfers button

A “Process bank transfers” button is available in the Sandbox [Dwolla Dashboard and Admin](https://dashboard-sandbox.dwolla.com). This button performs the same function as the "sandbox-simulations" endpoint (mentioned above) and allows you to simulate bank transfer processing in the Sandbox. Once the button is clicked, Dwolla will process or fail (see below for how-to trigger ACH failures) the last 500 bank transfers that occurred on your Sandbox account or the API Customer accounts you manage.

### Test RTP transfers

To create a Real-time payment (RTP) transfer, you need to attach a funding-source that is RTP enabled to your Customer. The Clearing House maintains lists of all [financial institutions](https://www.theclearinghouse.org/payment-systems/rtp/rtp-participating-financial-institutions) in the RTP® Network and all [RTP-enabled Routing/Transit Numbers](https://www.theclearinghouse.org/payment-systems/rtp/rtn). Use one of the routing numbers from the list to create an RTP-enabled funding-source in your Sandbox account. The account number can be any random number of 4-17 digits.

<AlertBar variation="warning">
  Real bank account numbers should not be used in a testing environment like
  Sandbox.

### Test Virtual Account Number transfers

External transfers can be simulated in the Dwolla Sandbox by using the sandbox-simulations endpoint with a request body that includes: a `type` field set to `virtual` and a `transfers` field with a list of transfers to process (see example below). Up to 10 transfers at a time can be included in one call to the sandbox simulations endpoint. Transfers will be created in an initial status of `pending` and will be updated to `processed` based on the times outlined below. A `failed` status can occur when the virtual account number (VAN) has been removed, the Customer has been `deactivated` or `suspended`, or when an ACH return code is assigned. Reference the [Testing Virtual Account Transfer Failures](#test-virtual-account-number-transfer-failures) section for more information on how to replicate a `failed` status.

Pending transfers will be processed automatically during the following times (all in Central Time):

- 2 a.m.
- 5 a.m.
- 8 a.m.
- 11 a.m.
- 1:15 p.m.
- 5:45 p.m.
- 8 p.m.

<AlertBar variation="info">
  The times listed above only apply to the Sandbox testing environment. In
  Production, external ACH transfers are processed at 11 a.m., 1:15 p.m. and
  5:45 p.m. (Central Time). This does not apply to any faster payment
  transactions. All times are subject to change.

### Test bank transfer failures

Transfers to or from a bank account can fail for a number of reasons (e.g. insufficient funds, invalid account number, etc.). When a bank transfer fails, the associated financial institution that rejected the transaction assigns an ACH return code and a transfer failure event is then triggered in Dwolla. Dwolla allows you to trigger various bank transfer failures by specifying an “R” code in the funding source `name` parameter when creating or [updating a funding source](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/funding-sources/update) for a Dwolla Account or API Customer. When a [transfer is initiated](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/transfers/initiate) using a funding source that has an “R” code assigned to its name, a transfer failure event will trigger and the status will update to failed when you simulate bank transfer processing (as mentioned above).

Dwolla allows you to pass in a few different sentinel values that are used to test different bank transfer failure scenarios. The list of available sentinel values cover the most common uses cases where ACH return codes can be triggered in production.

##### List of codes for testing bank transfer failures

| Return code | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| R01         | Insufficient Funds: This value is used to simulate funds failing from the source bank account (ACH debit).                                                                                                                                                                           |
| R03         | No Account/Unable to Locate Account: This value is primarily used to simulate funds failing to the destination bank account (ACH credit). The funding source will be automatically removed from Dwolla when this return code is triggered.                                           |
| R01-late    | This value is used to simulate funds failing from the source bank account post-settlement. Note: You must click “Process bank transfers” twice in order to test this scenario.                                                                                                       |
| R03-late    | This value is primarily used to simulate funds failing to the destination bank post-settlement. The funding source will be automatically removed from Dwolla when this return code is triggered. Note: You must click “Process bank transfers” twice in order to test this scenario. |

##### Example of using a sentinel value for testing bank transfer failures

This example assumes that a funding source has already been attached to an account. Once the funding source `name` has been updated to reflect the ACH failure scenario you want to test, then you can [initiate a transfer](https://developers.dwolla.com/api-reference/transfers/initiate) to or from that funding source via the API.

```bash
POST https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/funding-sources/692486f8-29f6-4516-a6a5-c69fd2ce854c
Accept: application/vnd.dwolla.v1.hal+json

```ruby
funding_source_url = 'https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/funding-sources/692486f8-29f6-4516-a6a5-c69fd2ce854c'
request_body = {
      "name" => "R03",
}

# Using DwollaV2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-ruby (Recommended)
funding_source = app_token.post "#{funding_source_url}", request_body
funding_source.name # => "R03"
```

request_body = {
  'name': 'R03'
}

# Using dwollav2 - https://github.com/Dwolla/dwolla-v2-python (Recommended)
funding_source = app_token.post(funding_source_url, request_body)
funding_source.body['name'] # => 'R03'
```

```javascript
var fundingSourceUrl =
  "https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/funding-sources/692486f8-29f6-4516-a6a5-c69fd2ce854c";
var requestBody = {
  name: "R03",
};

dwolla.post(fundingSourceUrl, requestBody).then((res) => res.body.name); // => "R03"
```

### Test Virtual Account Number transfer failures

Similar to [testing ACH bank transfer failures](#test-bank-transfer-failures), you can test a transfer failure with a virtual account number by specifying an "R" code in the "name" parameter when creating a VAN (e.g. “R08 Failure Test VAN”). The return code must be at the beginning of the VAN funding source’s name. **Note** that it is not case sensitive.
