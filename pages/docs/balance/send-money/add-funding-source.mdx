# Step 2: Adding a Funding Source

After creating our receive-only User, the next step is to attach a bank funding source. This will be the funding source where they will receive funds.

## Bank Addition and Verification methods

Within Dwolla, the sending party must always verify their bank account in order to be eligible to create a transfer. Although it’s recommended, the party that is receiving the funds does not need to undergo bank verification.

There are three ways of adding a bank to a Customer with the Dwolla API. A simplified table below outlines the similarities and differences of each method.

| Bank Addition Method                                                                                                  | Will the bank be `verified`?  | Required Information            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| API - Account & Routing Number                                                                                        | Optional - With Microdeposits | Bank Account and Routing Number |
| Third Party - Plaid ([Example](https://github.com/Dwolla/integration-examples/tree/main/dwolla-plaid-funding-source)) | Yes                           | Online Bank Credentials         |

## Step 2A: Adding a Bank to the Receive-only User

In this step, we will be adding a bank account to our receive-only user by collecting their bank details within a form on our application. After initial validation of the form fields, the user’s bank details will be submitted to our back-end server where the API request is made to Dwolla to add a bank account.

```php
<?php
$fundingApi = new DwollaSwagger\FundingsourcesApi($apiClient);

$new_fs = $fundingApi->createCustomerFundingSource([
  "routingNumber" => "222222226",
  "accountNumber" => "123456789",
  "bankAccountType" => "checking",
  "name" => "Jane Merchant - Checking 6789"

print($new_fs); # => https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/funding-sources/375c6781-2a17-476c-84f7-db7d2f6ffb31
?>
```

When the funding source is created, you will receive a `201` HTTP response with an empty response body. You can refer to the Location header to retrieve a link to the created funding source resource. We recommend storing the full URL for future use as it will be referenced when creating the transfer to this user’s bank account.

## Step 2B: Handle Webhooks

If you have an active webhook subscription (required in production & optional in Sandbox), you will receive the `customer_funding_source_created` <span><ContentTooltip preset="webhook">webhook</ContentTooltip></span> immediately after the resource has been created.
