# Step 2: Adding a Funding Source

Within Dwolla, the sending party must always have a verified funding source. Since your Customer is the one sending funds, they will need to both add and verify their bank funding source before being eligible to send funds.

The destination party, or the party receiving funds, does not need to have a verified funding source to receive these funds.

## Bank Addition and Verification Methods

There are multiple ways of adding a bank to a Customer with the Dwolla API. A simplified table below outlines the similarities and differences of each method.

| Bank Addition Method                                                                      | Will the bank be verified?    | Required Information            |

## Step 2A: Add a Bank to an Unverified Customer

In this step, we will create and attach a verified funding source to your Customer using Dwolla's Open Banking solution with Visa, a leading Open Banking service provider that Dwolla partners with. This method will give your Customers the ability to add and verify their bank account in a matter of seconds by authenticating using their online banking credentials.

Once your Customer reaches the page in your application to add a bank account, you will use Open Banking with Visa to authenticate the user's bank account. This involves initiating an <span><ContentTooltip preset="exchange-session">Exchange Session</ContentTooltip></span> with Dwolla, guiding the user through the verification process with their bank, and then using the <span><ContentTooltip preset="exchange">Exchange</ContentTooltip></span> details to create a funding source in Dwolla.

To integrate Open Banking with Visa, we recommend checking out our [integration guide](https://developers.dwolla.com/docs/balance/open-banking/visa). Additionally, if you would like to see a working example that verifies a bank using Open Banking with Visa and attaches it as a verified funding source to a Dwolla Customer, please check out our [open-banking/visa](https://github.com/Dwolla/integration-examples/tree/main/packages/open-banking/visa) integration example on our GitHub profile.

## Step 2B: Handle Webhooks

If you have an active webhook subscription, you should receive both the `customer_funding_source_added` and `customer_funding_source_verified` <span><ContentTooltip preset="webhook">webhooks</ContentTooltip></span> immediately following the request to Dwolla to add a funding source using Open Banking.
