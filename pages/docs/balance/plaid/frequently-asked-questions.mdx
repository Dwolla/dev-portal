# Frequently Asked Questions

      Q: How does Dwolla integrate with Plaid when a{" "}
      <code>processor_token</code> is received?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    When creating a funding source,{" "}
    <a href="https://developers.dwolla.com/guides/plaid/create-funding-source">
      a Plaid <code>processor_token</code> value is passed in using the{" "}
      <code>plaidToken</code> key.
    </a>{" "}
    With this information, Dwolla executes a call to Plaid's API to securely
    retrieve the account and routing number and creates a funding source on your
    behalf. Upon success, Dwolla returns a URL that represents the new funding
    source via the <code>Location</code> response header.

      Q: Does Plaid work if the user has two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled
      on their bank account?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    Yes, if the end user has 2FA enabled with their bank, Plaid will attempt to
    mimic their bank's login flow, meaning that the user should receive a 2FA
    code, and is subsequently prompted to enter it in on the next screen.

    <span>
      Q: If Plaid's <code>access_token</code> and <code>processor_token</code>{" "}
      changes or expires, what happens to the Dwolla funding source?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    If the <code>processor_token</code> has already been used to create a
    funding source, then the token changing or expiring will not affect it;
    Dwolla only uses the <code>processor_token</code> to fetch the account and
    routing number from Plaid and then immediately discards it.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    However, if you have not yet used the <code>processor_token</code> to create
    a funding source, then you will need to follow Plaid's process for creating
    a new token before sending it over to Dwolla.

    <span>
      Q: Can I use Plaid's micro-deposit solution instead of Dwolla's?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    Yes, it is possible to use Plaid Link to both automatically verify bank
    accounts and manually verify via micro-deposits if the bank is not supported
    or an error occurs during automatic verification.
  </p>

<Collapsible
  triggerText={
    <span>
      Q: Will Dwolla's funding source status change if Plaid's account status
      changes (e.g., micro-deposit verification)?
    </span>
  }
>
  <p>
    No. Since Dwolla only uses Plaid to securely retrieve the account and
    routing number, any changes to the underlying Plaid account will not affect
    the funding source(s) that have already been created in Dwolla.
