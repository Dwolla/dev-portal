### 2019-02-21

**UPDATED**

- Dwolla allows an application to request an access token using its Client Id and Client Secret by leveraging the Client Credentials OAuth grant type. Access tokens are used to make requests to the Dwolla API on behalf of an application and its users (customers).
- Previously, applications made a call to `https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/v2/token` and specified the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` `Content-Type` header, passing their client credentials (App Key and App Secret) through the body of the HTTP message sent to Dwolla.
- With this update, the token URL as well as the manner in which an application’s client credentials are sent to Dwolla, will change to be inline with OAuth spec.
- The new Dwolla token exchange endpoint is `https://api.dwolla.com/token`
- Reference our [API Reference Docs](https://docs.dwolla.com/#application-authorization) to learn more.

### 2017-11-16

**CHANGED**

- Bank [balance check](https://docs.dwolla.com/#retrieve-a-funding-source-balance) functionality changing to be asynchronous and immediately return an HTTP 202. The response body for the 202 will contain a status relating to the processing of this request. Subsequent requests to this endpoint will return a 202 up until processing completes and then either return an HTTP 200 with the current balance or an HTTP 400 if there was an error (i.e. `UnsupportedBank`).

### 2017-11-16

**ADDED**

- Added a new `customer_balance_inquiry_completed` event. Upon checking a Customer’s bank balance, Dwolla will immediately return an HTTP 202 with response body that includes a status of processing. This event will be triggered when the bank balance check has completed processing. To read more on how to trigger this event, check out our [forum post](https://discuss.dwolla.com/t/check-it-out-new-events/4554).

### 2017-11-04

**ADDED**

- Added a new `customer_bank_transfer_creation_failed` event. This event will be triggered when an attempt to initiate a transfer to a verified Customer’s bank was made, but failed. Transfers initiated to a verified Customer’s bank must pass through the verified Customer’s balance before being sent to a receiving bank. Dwolla will fail to create a transaction intended for a verified Customer’s bank if the funds available in the balance are less than the transfer amount. To read more on how to trigger this event, check out our [forum post](https://discuss.dwolla.com/t/check-it-out-new-events/4554).
