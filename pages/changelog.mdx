# Changelog

Keep up to date on new product features and enhancements, API docs, tools changes, and development updates.

## Upcoming

### 2023-08-31

**DEPRECATED**

- Dwolla will be discontinuing support for `dwolla.js` library, which supports adding an unverified bank funding source. Check out the official [announcement](https://discuss.dwolla.com/t/may-2023-updates-retiring-dwolla-s-client-side-javascript-library-dwolla-js/8969).

This library will serve as our primary web UI components library and offer an enhanced developer experience.

**UPDATED**

- Dwolla allows an application to request an access token using its Client Id and Client Secret by leveraging the Client Credentials OAuth grant type. Access tokens are used to make requests to the Dwolla API on behalf of an application and its users (customers).
- Previously, applications made a call to `https://www.dwolla.com/oauth/v2/token` and specified the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` `Content-Type` header, passing their client credentials (App Key and App Secret) through the body of the HTTP message sent to Dwolla.
- With this update, the token URL as well as the manner in which an application’s client credentials are sent to Dwolla, will change to be inline with OAuth spec.
- The new Dwolla token exchange endpoint is `https://api.dwolla.com/token`
